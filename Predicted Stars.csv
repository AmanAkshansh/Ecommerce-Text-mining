The restaurant seemed fairly full even on a Tuesday evening; we had secured reservations just a couple days before.

My friend and I had sampled sandwiches at the Farm Kitchen earlier that week, and were impressed enough to want to eat at the restaurant.  The crisp, fresh veggies didn't disappoint: we ordered the salad with orange and grapefruit slices and the crudites to start.  Both were very good; I didn't even know how much I liked raw radishes and turnips until I tried them with their pesto and aioli sauces.

For entrees, I ordered the lamb and my friend ordered the pork shoulder.  Service started out very good, but trailed off quickly.  Waiting for our food took a very long time (a couple seated after us received and finished their entrees before we received our's), and no one bothered to explain the situation until the maitre'd apologized almost 45 minutes later.  Apparently the chef was unhappy with the sauce on my entree, so he started anew.  This isn't really a problem, but they should have communicated this to us earlier.  For our troubles, they comped me the glass of wine I ordered, but they forgot to bring out with my entree  as I had requested.  Also, they didn't offer us bread, but I will echo the lady who whispered this to us on her way out: ask for the bread.  We received warm foccacia, apple walnut, and pomegranate slices of wonder with honey and butter.  YUM.

The entrees were both solid, but didn't quite live up to the innovation and freshness of the vegetables.  My lamb's sauce was delicious, but the meat was tough.  Maybe the vegetarian entrees are the way to go?  But our dessert, the gingerbread pear cake, was yet another winner.

If the entrees were tad more inspired, or the service weren't so spotty, this place definitely would have warranted five stars.  If I return, I'd like to try the 75$ tasting menu.  Our bill came out to about 100$ for two people, including tip, no drinks.",4,3,1,5.5,"Positive","5"

I went there by myself on a Wednesday night in hopes of finding some friendly folks and that is exactly what happened. I ate dinner at the bar. Marcy was the bartender and she was very friendly and helpful and she introduced me to a whole bunch of people. For dinner I had a Rueben sandwich, which was pretty large and very good. I had a a small Rosie salad as my side and it did the job. I wish it was made with lettuce other than iceburg, but the bacon & eggs & other toppings helped a whole lot. I drank a nice, cold Smithwick's from the tap. Followed that up with 2 vodka tonics and my whole tab was under $25! 

The basketball game was on when I first got there. After the game, the jukebox was playing a fabulous mix of the best oldies. Around 10pm a live band played. I didn't catch much of their performance but I did notice that I really like the singer's voice and that's rare for me since I don't typically care for female vocalists.


All the people I spoke to were super nice and very welcoming. I am sure I will see a bunch (or all) of them again and I look forward to that!",1,1,0,6,"Positive","4"
"17","HXP_0Ul-FCmA4f-k9CqvaQ","3","We went here on a Saturday afternoon and this place was incredibly empty.  They had brunch specials going on, including $2 bloody mary's and mimosas, but we were more in the mood for lunch.  Except for the bloody mary, I had to try one.  It came out in a high-ball-sized glass.  Boo!  But it was really tasty. Yay!  The hubby remembered a sign outside the restaurant a few weeks back that said they had Arrogant Bastard, and he got a 22 oz bottle for $4.75.  Hey, that's not fair!!

Next up: the wings.  We were a bit hesitant to order them when the waitress informed us that they are ""seasoned"" but not sauced, so they can't be ordered hot.  We did ask for them crispy though, and the waitress even asked the cooks to throw them back in for a few minutes when they came out not visibly crispy.  These non-traditional wings were actually pretty damn good.  The seasoning was a little spicy and salty with just a hint of sweet.  If I were in the mood for the tang and kick of Frank's Hot Sauce, these wouldn't cut it, but otherwise they were good enough to go back again for.

My entree was the Tilapia salad, and I was a bit disappointed.  The fish was a bit dry and uninspired. And the greens underneath were overdressed and wilted.  I ate the greens around the fish and picked out the almonds and Mandarin oranges, but I had to leave the mush hiding underneath the fish.

It wasn't bad enough to say I wouldn't go back, but I won't be anxiously awaiting my next trip.",3,4,2,1,"Positive","4"

Loved the water feature and patio walking in, if it had been warmer I would have definitely sat outside. 

Inside was a little dark and I guess it was all the bats around but it reminded me of ""Dusk Till Dawn"". 

We were seated, I hope was hoping for chips and salsa, I guess they don't serve them here? 
We weren't even offered the ones on the menu, which I probably would have declined anyway because chips and salsa should be complimentary. 

Anyhow I ordered the Fresh Snapper Tacos (see pics) 
There is a lot of fish there being smothered by all those peppers, but as for everything else what you see is what you get.

For $15 I would have liked more than a TBSP of each, rice and beans, and a DEFINITELY more than a teaspoon of cheese and sour cream and maybe a lime or lemon. 
There was more garnish on the plate than anything. Other than that it was good. 

My Friend ordered the Green Chile Stew and The Green Chile Mac and Cheese (see pics) She has been here before so knew what she liked. I tasted the macaroni and thought it was pretty good too.

My last contact with them was a few days ago when I was having trouble redeeming some Groupons on their website. I called customer service and after waiting a few minutes I spoke with a rep who cheerfully booked four separate flights for me, patiently and manually entering my Groupon info for each one.

I think the acquisition by Republic has helped them overall. After Republic took over the in-flight cookies started.

"26","ChBeixVZerfFkeO0McdlbA","4","This place is great.  A nice little ole' fashion homemade ice cream place that looks like it has been there for forever.  The place has a real nice vibe to it.  Sorta reminds me of Sugar Bowl only smaller, not as busy, and easier parking.

The menu is ginormous.  I couldn't decide what to get but that didn't matter because the other 3 people I went with chose for me.  I wanted something basic but they insisted on sharing the 'patte' thing.  It is a few scoops of ice cream over a brownie and topped with whip cream and caramel.  While it was very good it just wasn't what I wanted.  Next time I'm just going to get a scoop or 2 of the ice cream so I can really taste what the ice cream is all about.  It is just too difficult to tell when it is topped with a bunch of stuff.  The ice cream we got on the brownie though (butter brittle I think) was excellent.  They have tons of different flavors and they all sound delish!

Place was empty at 9am on a Tuesday morning but the atmosphere was casual, this place is pretty much been here for as long as I can remember and I am one of the 2 people that are native to Phoenix.  I always felt it was pricey but I think inflation has caught up since prices seemed normal when I went yesterday.  I loved the chips and salsa, the hot sauce is fantastic with a great spicy kick.  I went with the recommendation of the chile relleno which isn't my favorite but I like going with what waiters say so I gave it a try.  It was great!  Very flavorful and they just put it on the eggs so you can eat it together, the tortillas are fresh and home-made tasting, the hash browns and beans were good too.

"33","-v-shjbxoj7hpU62yn6vag","5","Never having dealt with a Discount Tire in Phoenix before (only in Texas, and their service has been great all the time), I came in not knowing what kind of service to expect. I was pleasantly surprised! The store had a good amount of parking, and the store front was clean, open and had adequate seating around the perimeters. There were already 5-6 people sitting and waiting for their cars to be finished, and 2 people waiting infront of me to see a representative. All the guys working there were busy helping someone, yet were saying hello to us and reassuring they'd get to us very soon. I didn't wait an unneccesary amount of time and then was helped by Wally. He inspected my tires, recommended a plan of action gave me options, and we headed back into the store. After I made my decision to replace 2 of the tires, he checked their stock, and unfortunately they didn't have them there. BUT he called another store and had them picked up for the next morning, so I could just come back the next day to this same store and get those bad boys installed. Great! The prices were not as heafty (relief), and although there were a good amount of people the next day waiting for their cars to also be serviced, it took exactly the amount of time they'd told me (45 min). They apologized for the wait, but no need for that! The guy who helped me on the 2nd day (I'm sorry I forgot his name) was also very professional and great. I recommend this store and will be bringing my car here in the future most definitely. Thanks, guys!

I thought the scramble I had was okay but nothing fantastic. I definitely didn't care for the biscuits. The food wasn't health conscious at all but if you're looking to fill up with calories and get a good-sized portion then this is your type of place. Also, I am not a fan of the diner-type ambiance...

- Cheap: $1-2/plate
- Fast: It's ready-to-go and on a conveyor
- Acceptable quality: I'm here weekly and haven't gotten sick lol

This place is definitely good for what it is, ""it"" being a budget-friendly sushi place that's great for a quick bite.  In a response to the lower-rating reviews stating how the food is just okay at best or authentic or blah blah blah, well think of it like wal-mart vs. *inserthighendretailerhere*.  This place has a business model based on selling in large volumes (hence the low prices like wal-mart) so they're gonna have to ""reduce costs"" somehow (so-so quality food, not-so-attentive staff, and slightly smaller than average portions), but it's still a solid bang-for-your-buck kinda place.

On top of this, I can be in and out quickly since everything is already prepared, perfect for those quick 30 min lunch breaks.  All that's required is for you to grab it off the conveyor (depending on whether or not all the items you want are on the conveyor at the time). 

I've never had issues with seating, but do not make a point to go during peak hours and usually go with a small party (2-4 people).

For those claiming to be ""left to fend for themselves"" due to an inattentive staff, most of your sushi-related inquiries can be answered by this thing called ""the menu"" that sits on the counters.  See, this miraculous piece of technology contains things referred to as ""descriptions"" on them that help to inform you about the sushi going round-and-round before you.  Furthermore, there's even a pricing guide based on the color code of the plates to assist you further! WOW! Lol wtf do people expect for $1-2 plates of sushi?  Someone to hold your hand?

And the cherry on top? $4 large japanese beers and $5 sake bombs! HELL YEAH!",1,0,1,2.5,"Positive","4"
"56","6jRs2P6zTYMn36fVnCu1Zw","4","In our continuing quest to identify cool, locally owned places to eat and/or drink, Caroline and I auditioned Vintage 95 last night. 

Before I go further, understand that whenever I go out for eats or drinks, I have  in  mind a Platonic Ideal of the Bar/Pub/Eatery I most want to frequent. I'm on a constant quest to find that  Ideal expressed in Real Life. 

Vintage 95 isn't quite there, but it's damn close. If I ever give something Five Stars, you'll know it has pegged my Platonic Ideal. Anyway...

The plan last night was for drinks. No plans for food, just Adult Beverages and warm conversation. But it turned into more.

The location in downtown Chandler is terrific for us. The owners have created a very fine visual experience - leather, stone, dark woods, good lighting. And they don't have the music turned up so loud that you CANNOT HAVE A CONVERSATION. This is one of my pet peeves. If I want to stare at people move their mouths while enduring an aural assault, I'll stand on the deck of an aircraft carrier. When I go out with friends, I want to enjoy their company AND their conversation. Is that concept so difficult to grasp? [/rant off]

The atmosphere at Vintage 95 is very close to my Ideal. I'd go back just to sit on the leather couches in front of the fireplace, and then go back another time to sit on the leather stools at the bar, and then go back about fourteen more times to sit out on the patio. Seriously - go check out the patio. It is EXACTLY what a Patio Hangout Bar should be. EXACTLY.

Caroline and I told the hostesses we were only there for drinks, so we were seated in the bar area in some fabulous leather club chairs. It wasn't initmate, but we weren't looking for intimate. And speaking of the bar, even though V95 advertises itself as a wine bar, they DO have booze. I'm not much of a wine drinker and was very pleased to see that they carried a pretty good selection of single malt scotches. Not an overwhelming selection, but well beyond the normal Glenfiddich /Glenlivit /GlenMorangie trio to which most places are limited. I had a couple of drums of Ardbeg, which is one of my new favorites and very reasonably priced at retail. (Scotch is never reasonably priced in restaurants, but I was celebrating so I didn't care.) Caroline had her normal ""vodka martini extra dirty extra cold"" which she judged to have ""perfect dirtiness"", (no wonder I love her!), perfect amount of olives and very cold. 

The limited Happy Hour menu had some very interesting choices. We settled on the bruschetta and the smoked tomato bisque. The bruschetta was VERY nice and quite unusual. You get to select four of eight choices for your bruschetta platter; we picked: (1) white bean and pancetta, (2) gravlax, caper goat cheese and pickled onions, (3) fig chutney, ricotta and prosciutto, (4) brie, pear and onion jam. They were all served cold, in nice sized portions and the flavors were all nicely balanced and very interesting. Caroline would have preferred the bread to not be so crispy, but I really liked it. The tomato bisque  was creamy, smoky and had well-balanced flavor. Caroline said it was unique and I say it was just darn delicious. 

Things being as they are, drinks and appetizers turned into food. A friend had told us ""you have to try the Vintage burger"", so we did. It came served with a mixture of regular and sweet potato fries, all nicely cooked and nicely seasoned. Recommended. The burger was VERY tasty. They obviously use good beef, the bun was fresh, the fixin's were tasty. HIGHLY recommended.

In for a dime, in for a dollar, right? So we ordered dessert. Again, the dessert menu is short, but I'm okay with that as long as they do it well. Chocolate torte with hazelnut gelato, apple pie with carmel sauce and creme fraiche gelato, and something else we couldn't remember. I'm allergic to hazelnut and don't like sweet desserts, so we decided to try the apple pie.

Like everything else we had sampled, the apple pie was unusual - you wouldn't find it anywhere else. It was served on a freshly baked puff pastry, cubed apples served on top and inside - tender but not mushy -  with lots of cinnamon and sugar, plate was swirled with salted dolce la leche. It was tasty, but instead of the expected creme fraiche gelato, we were served hazelnut gelato. I didn't realize it was hazelnut until I'd had a couple of bites and my throat started to swell up.

At this point that the night could have turned into a disaster, but to their credit - it didn't. We told the waiter who told the manager, (Gavin - one of the owners), who immediately came and asked if I needed emergency assistance. I didn't, I'm not THAT allergic.)  Frankly, their response was EXACTLY the kind of customer service you want to see. Anyone can make a mistake, so no harm, no foul. But I must give BIG Kudos to Gavin for his kindness, attention to detail and outstanding customer service.

With all the hype of getting a Margaritaville I guess was expecting a little more in the way of Margaritas and cheeseburgers. But I was underwhelmed with both.

No matter how busy the restaurant becomes, and on Sunday it is packed,  the staff is always friendly and welcoming.

The people that I invited that had never been to AB before were expecting more of a variety in brunch items since I'd told them that they had great brunch, but their concerns were quelled with a few bloody Marys and some good (if not diverse) food.  I had the egg sandwich sans bacon again (excellent again) and Sweet Pea and I split the french toast as well.  We'd only had a small sample of the french toast at the opening, so we didn't realize that it comes with this whole jar of cream and berries, in addition to the syrup.  If you come here for brunch and like french toast, you have to try it.  It's the best french toast I've ever had, and many at our table agreed.  The secret is that they bread it in cornflakes.  Yum.

"81","vwHmBJ5YKbZxNFtmP2KpRQ","4","The vibe exuding from this place is pure awesomeness. Reminiscent of a trendy hipster coffee joint, this is actually a casual vegan restaurant. 

I am a pescatarian and unless I am eating seafood, I steer clear of meat, even the mock kind usually however once in a while it's delicious... so why try it here at Green I thought. The menu's style is comfort food, which as we all know traditionally is heavy on the meat, sauces, and fat content... so at least if you're going to be bad, you can do it with organic and pure ingredients.


So as I wanted to sample as much of the menu as possible, my lovely friend, her fiance, and I shared a few items:

*Artichoke Gratine: The corn chips were amazing, lightly salted and crisp. The dip was a bit too garlicky and runny for my liking. Ate a few bites of this but could not see myself eating the entire thing solo.

*Spicy Buffalo ""Wings"": first things first... do not let looks dismay you... true it looks gross but they taste legit! The flavor of the buffalo sauce was perfect, although could have been spicier. And the cucumber ranch dipping sauce was perfectly creamy and lightly flavored as to not overpower the ""wings"". This dish is a must try!!

*Vegan Chili Fries: the fries are thin cut and tasty. The chili sauce was good, at first, but I quickly got sick of the flavor. This could be because I was never a huge chili fan even back when I ate meat. Hmm, I think you are better off ordering the thyme fries.

*Crab Puffs: Perfectly crisp with a delicious creamy filling. Another must try!

Lastly my friend's fiance ordered that day's special which was a green chili burrito... delicious and huge. A bit too much rice but besides that a great option. It came with a side, which he ordered the curry pasta salad, mmm.


Green serves bowls, sandwiches, pizzas, salads... next time I am back in the area I will be checking out more of the menu when craving ""meat"" and not my usual tofu, seafood, veggie diet.

"83","xE2MKvzes5Twg-jfAe8s4Q","5","Beer...or Yoga?

Located in a small center just east of Four Peaks Brewery in Tempe (a reasonable distance from the light rail on Apache), is an amazing, classy studio for the Mind-Body connection.

Mr. Mustachio had decided after doing a couple yoga classes with me at the ASU gym that he loved the stretch, so pursued a class for a semester at ASU this Spring and had the pleasure of practicing with Tish Hegel. After seeing his body transform to only 16.2% body fat, all his jeans get too big on him and fill out his American Apparel briefs nicely I was super jealous. He raved about his teacher and I could tell he had de-stressed a lot since he started the practice.

Luckily, she opened up a studio recently, and it simply goregous. The waiting area is filled with yoga material and a very calming space with a remodeled bathroom and dressing rooms to change if coming from work/school.

That is right- the only person staring at my pudge rolls is my teacher and who-ever isn't focusing on their tree posture-not the entire class! It really relieves a lot of stress  and helps me concentrate on how a posture feels as opposed to just looks.

As for Tish Hegel, she is simply outstanding-she has so many credentials, you have to read her biography for yourself. She has been practicing for a loooong time, and her hands-on instruction and confident voice echoes in my ears even now (bring those shoulders down!). 

So far, I have done:  Ashtanga Inspired Flow (pretty intense, really hurt for 3 days, would recommend after getting into yoga for a while), Sivananda (ditto),  Focus Class (did a lot of bike riding and she focused on everybody's body issues and did the sequence right then and there for us and my lower back and knees felt amazing the day after) and this morning brought my friend to Kinetic Yoga: Morning Movement and Flow, which kicked our 6am asses a little bit but we both felt amazing afterwards!  She does tons of modifications, is always making sure we are okay, and is just super personable.

The fifth of gin that I slammed in the parking lot really helped with that last bit of extra courage that I needed to partake my journey into hippie-land.

I like places that spend the time to make their own salad dressings and take care with creating a delicious salad. The Italia was DELICIOUS and a perfect size! The homemade Minestrone soup was loaded with fresh ingredients and was REALLY fantastic too!

Honestly had I not been told it was curry, I wouldn't really have identified it as curry. The duck came with some plain steamed vegetables on the side, which as the meal went on, served to further water down my already bland curry sauce as the veggie water moved around on the plate. In addition to the curry lacking flavor, the vegetables really needed a boost as well. They should have been stir fried, or been served with a sauce of some sort.

The meat was tender and flavorful; our table ordered the NY, Ribeye and Salmon. I do agree with others who said that the sides were a little small, but I do think they were worth the price. I know for sure the cream of corn was, as it was treated with green chili and a bit of spice. 

The desert was alright. Not a great deal of variety. The textures were spot on, but the temperatures seems a bit off. If a dish was intended to be served warm, it was slightly too cold, etc.

The resort is absolutely top-notch, the rooms are very spacious, the staff is very courteous, and the facilities are simply superb.  Our room overlooked the mountain, and in the morning, it was blissful to sit outside and sip on our cups of joe. 

The rooms have a microwave and a small fridge, something that was invaluable to us to store milk and warm it up for our little one.  The spa is simply one of the best in the valley, and even if you don't stay here, I would recommend the spa to anyone.  The resort is close to at least 20 golf courses, something that might be important to other golf nuts like me. 

So then why not 5 stars? Simply because they would not extend the check-out time for us by even an hour.  The check-out is 11 am and our flight was delayed to 8 pm, so when I requested, I was told VERY NICELY, but firmly that it wasn't going to happen.  I've traveled some, and have NEVER been turned down for a late check-out request, ever.

I've since been here twice (over about a 3 month time span), and I really love it.

The garlic app - what it is called? - your server will know, it's probably their most popular dish, it is AMAZING.  Order this unless you hate garlic or are on a diet.

I am a huge fan of anything the Camelback Inn does, especially since they offer live music and a great space for relaxation and Rita's Kitchen is no exception. This restaurant is airy and opens up to the spacious Camelback Inn patio where they play live music every night. 

Breakfast: 

Breakfast at Rita's is sublime and pretty reasonably priced. They offer a breakfast buffet for around $23 which includes eggs made to order (including omelets), pancakes, waffles, pastries, fresh fruit, bacon, sausage and hashbrowns. It's a great pick for a leisurely weekend breakfast.

I happily ate my Creamed Spinach (2 star yummy) and didn't eat more then 2 bones of the ribs. When the waitress came to clear the plates (she never checked on us) she asked if I was full. I told her that the ribs weren't to my liking.. she smiled and asked if I wanted dessert. 

Over all I would never come back to Don and Charlie's.. aside from the  Creamed Spinach, which I can make myself, there weren't many redeeming qualities. A shame too because it's so close to the house. I don't get it because the Yelps are so good. Maybe they were having  a bad night? It was so bad I wouldn't ever go back to find out.",4,10,1,-3,"Negative","1"

(i.e. A lot of people trying waaaay to hard to look and act cool.)  We had a good time, but I probably wouldn't go out of my way to go back there anytime soon.

I was by myself and felt as though everyone else that came walking in were immediately welcomed.  I wish I would have received the same attention. I was ready to walk out when i was finally approached. Nobody came back to check on me to make sure everything was ok after they delivered my food. Being from Vegas I am not accustomed to such non attentive service staff. I guess that flys here in Scottsdale, but I expected more from the type of clientele that they have. On a positive note, they do have a cozy place that gives the feel of a French coffee shop/bistro.

it's been on the corner of mill and university for as long as i can remember, which is impressive since nothing older than ten years has been able to withstand the rent increases, and even more impressive because i don't know a single person who goes there.

i went in there one time, for drinks and walked past one of the foulest salad bars I've ever seen. for some reason, it's right by the door. instead of walking in to see a hostess stand you walk right into this brown mess of vegetables.

after seeing that first off, i wouldn't dream of ordering food here. the place is also dark and dirty and there's never anyone inside of it.

There was a word that we used for poachers that did the same thing while hunting deer, when I was a kid back in Oregon...""Asshole"".

The Beautiful Carin and I were in Scottsdale on business this past week and we take these opportunities to spend time with those near and dear to us!

At the very tippy top of the ""near and dear"" list is our lovely daughter, Whitney.

Whit is a Vegan...with a capital ""Vege""...and she was distraught by the wanton slaughter of an African elephant by some dot bomb misogynist.

So she was thrilled that her meat lovin' daddy was going to take her to Green for dinner...an experience so very alien to me that I made Carin pick up a pound of fully cooked bacon and bring it to dinner in her purse for me...just in case!

I am not a Vegan...I was born and raised on a cattle ranch...I do love a good medium rare rib-eye...I don't think it hurts Elsie the Cow to have a teat twiddled so I can have cream in  my coffee or cheese on my burger...and yet, the elephant deal brought a tear to my daughters eye and touched my black flinty excuse for a heart!

I checked Yelp and saw that while my Vegan friends on yelp love this place, my decidedly carnivorous Yelpy friends were also nearly unanimous in their agreement that Green is foodgasm inducing!

We ordered way too much food...Chili Fries, Egg Rolls, a Green Burger, the Secret BBQ Chicken Sandwich, No Harm Chicken Parm...I barely had room to choke down a couple of Tsoynami's and an oatmeal cookie sandwich!

Even after we were stuffed, Whitney took home enough leftovers for a week!

The big question about Green is ""why didn't I ever eat here, when I lived here...Why?""

I don't know...but I will be putting on my hemp cargo shorts, a tie dye t-shirt and growing a neck beard...and I will be eating here again.

I like to ""fit in"".

The menu is fairly extensive...the portions are plenty big...the flavors are bright and well defined and the textures and aroma's (always a big deal for me) are both exotic and welcoming.

I didn't have to break out the bacon (although I should have taken my flask...no cocktails at Green for Donald...oh well, agave sugar cola was a delightful departure from the ordinary).

I really could eat this way on a regular basis...it's that good...I probably won't, but it's nice to know I could!

I imagine that Karma will have it's own way of dealing with a self-justifying, trigger happy technotard...for me, the occasional dinner at Green nicely balances the Karmic forces at work in my life...and tastes good, too!",13,9,16,6,"Positive","4"

I went to an event here, and haved stayed here a few times.  JW Marriott has hosted a few wine tastings that I've gone to, and the resort is super nice, with a staff that is ready and waiting to help you no matter what it is you need.

The rooms were decently sized and the bed was big and comfy.  The bathroom was nice as well.   The resort has a lot of fountains around and huge windows so you can check out the great views.

The pool area is where it's at though.  They have a great lazy river to nurse your hangover on, and a water slide for when you're feeling better.  Of course you can get drink and food service out there and you can even rent a cabana- which I recommend.   It's not that pricey- around $100, so if you get a few people to go in with you, it's no biggie smalls.

"469","XS5Lvk8WFNmS0bCqdl-agw","1","My family and I ate here just a few days ago. It was an experience that left me yearning for more out of a restaurant I have seen so crowded over the years and decided to try with a group of 7 of us in the family. First off we got there at 10 am and were missing only two in our party so we had to wait to be seated which was fine. Once the rest of our party showed up at 10:07 we were not seated until after 10:30. When we were seated we were all scrunched together at a medium sized table that would comfortable seat 5 adults. Well, there were 7 of us total and needless to say it was very tight! The waitress stated that we could take our water and go wait back up front for a bigger table but we were looking at roughly 40 minutes of waiting again!!! Seriously? We ordered drinks first and the waitress brought my father his tomato juice and almost spilled it on him but instead spilled it all over her hand. Then she sat the glass down in front of him with juice on table and all over glass and left! She never came back with a wet towel to clean up her mess!! We all ordered and the food arrived quickly. This was the only part of the experience that was good, sadly to say. We received our food order for 7 of us within 15-20 minutes which was excellent. My uncle and grandmother both had charred toast (it was black, not just black around the edges) . The bacon looked like dried strips of hard leather. Overall, none of us will be returning to this place! It was is so overrated. We are headed back to RANDY'S here in Scottsdale to do our next family breakfast.",0,0,0,0.5,"Positive","5"

After a few stressful weeks of work, school and planning a wedding I suddenly remembered I am a better version of myself when I take adult time outs. My ""corner"", so to speak, was at Joya spa. I just so happen to remember a TravelZoo purchase I made a few months ago for a massage or facial at Joya Spa at the Montelucia Resort in Phoenix.
Boy, was I excited! I called, booked an appointment with a male therapist and started to prepare myself for my next great spa adventure. 
After anxiously awaiting  Sunday to roll around, I finally found myself walking into a Moroccan paradise. The space was entrancing from the moment I walked in. It smelled like a spa and helped to set the mood for my day of relaxation. I was given a full tour of the facilities and allowed to set my intentions with small crystals in a round room, and then brought into a room with a GIANT crystal used to help calm, bring intention and awareness of your visit and to yourself. The woman giving me the tour was very professional and thorough. Though informative, I was waiting for a warm connection from her, and never received it.
After being led to the locker room, I changed into my bathing suit and waited in the woman's lounge for my provider to find me and take me back for my massage experience.
I chose a male provider. Knowing I had tension, knots and stress I was hoping for a firm, slow, relaxing massage. I have had MANY massages and this one was actually a little disappointing. My therapist picked me 7 minutes late and ended 5 minutes early. The strokes consisted of a lot of rocking and fast movements. Not really the relaxing experience I was craving. My massage therapist was very sweet and genuine in his approach, I was just hoping for something more.
I definitely didn't let my treatment ruin my experience! The facilities were amazing!  They were clean and always stocked with towels. I have to say the spa attendants ROCKED!!!!! I could not believe how efficient they were. I observed on 5 occasions (YES 5) every time a shower was vacant an attendant was there to clean it up, any time a towel was on the floor, it got picked up immediately. They worked together like a well oiled machine! And I would love to give them props for making me take notice to the work the do!
I plan on returning! I may not receive a massage because of my experience, but I truly enjoyed the facilities and the staff. I'm even thinking of booking a suite for my bridal party to enjoy the day there. In the end, if you know massage the way I do, please beware, you may not get all the bang for your buck in your treatment.",2,3,2,8,"Positive","5"

Mom and I missed our reservation at Cowboy Ciao's on a Friday night and a worker recommended us to visit the sister restaurant ""Kazimierz."" Ok, we'll go as long as they have the famous Stetson Chopped salad. My mom loved the salad when she went to Cowboy Ciao.

So we enter the restaurant and the place is so dark. How the heck are you suppose to find a table and read the menu?? We had no idea how the seating worked, so we asked a worker.

The first time I went there was with the pseudo boyfriend and he adored his meal, and so I embraced it and loved it.  The second time was last night for Dottsy's birthday dinner.  

Dottsy and I ordered up the guacamole that everyone raves about.  We were unimpressed, as we had huge chunks of avocado in there and have both made our own guacamole and didn't see what the big fuss was about.  

I've had the enchiladas suizas and enchiladas de hongas and although they weren't bad- they were not amazing.  Not worth the 16 bucks, at all.  Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't complain about the cost if it tasted like it was worth it, but not so much.

Because it was Dottsy's birthday, they brought her a complimentary flan which we both agreed was pretty tasty flan.  So, if you are a flan person, this may be a place to check out.

However, when you arrive at 7:00pm, and they say you won't be seated until 11:30pm, that doesn't mean you can put your name in and show up at 11...which we almost found out the hard way: **At 10:00pm they will do one last head count. If you're not in the vicinity, soooorrrrry!** Luckily we were calling in every hour for updates (which they recommend, btw). At 9:40pm we called and got the news that we better be there for the last head count (information we probably could have used earlier), and had to hurry on back from our meanderings downtown.

    Yelpers Jim W and Audrey W were reportedly seen enjoying lively conversation and delicious Indian food with Donald S and Carin S.  Witnesses claim the group was laughing loudly at times.  One bystander reported, ""That was a guffaw.  That outburst right there was definitely a guffaw.  Wild stuff.""

    Sources have related to this publication that the group dined on two appetizers, one known as a bread basket which consisted of four types of naan bread.  Jim W was overheard to say, ""I really like the onion naan.""  The other appetizer may have been Aloo Tikki.  This has not been confirmed as yet.  In any case the plate containing the reported Aloo Tikki was cleaned by the foursome, several even going so far as to swab at the remaining sauce on the plate.

    The above sources also reported that the table was served an order of the Friday daily special of Kahari Shrimp.  It was overheard by a nearby table that the shrimp was ""...flavorful with strong notes of garlic and ginger.""  This has not substantiated, however.

    Audrey W reportedly was served the Lamb Korma which she was rumored to have noted was ""Yummy.""

    Carin S apparently was served the Chicken Masala and Donald S may have been served some sort of Vindaloo that included potato.  It seems there was considerable sharing of the dishes around the table and the main dishes may have been spooned over what some experts have suggested was a basmati rice with various herbs and spices.

    An unnamed source has informed this publication that while Jim W claims to have particularly enjoyed the food and festive atmosphere which included a belly dancer and some swordplay, he was displeased with the excessive sound level produced by the in-house sound system and even requested that the music be reduced.

    Jim W's blog had a statement this morning that read, in part; ""...ears haven't hurt the next morning like that since my last rock concert.  I really liked the food but I wouldn't go back on a night when they have dancing again.""",22,23,27,1.5,"Positive","4"

"563","6BVDp3xFEJr7vgHyWyFr6g","5","Okay I have found my new favorite ""home office!""  I don't have an office for my agency yet so coffee shops tend to be where I get most of my work done.

Last week I checked out Echo Coffee for a client meeting and we both really liked it.  Today I returned and spent a few hours working at Echo Coffee on their wi-fi. It was such a nice break from my usual home office at Starbucks.  Walking into Echo Coffee you can instantly tell its a different type of coffee experience.  The environment is very relaxing, music is not blasting so customers don't have to scream over each other, and they have great big couches in the back.  Of course atmosphere and great coffee needs to be in balance and it definitely was at Echo.

The coffee is really good and love very fair price for the quality you get (my 2 favs are Cappuccino at $2.75 and $3.75 for large Chai Latte).  My chai latte came in a big ceramic mug.  I don't know about you but there is just something special enjoying coffee out of big mugs and not recyclable paper cups.

A surprising first for me is getting actual lunch at a coffee place and was pleasantly surprised to find the food was also really good.  Can you tell I am a fan yet?  I ordered a Curry Chicken sandwich and it was huge and delicious so finished the whole thing.  There was a nice bonus on the plate - Mango Chutney so make sure you get that if you order lunch at Echo.  I would have loved just a bowl of that and bread as its flavor was so good.  I need to find out where they get this from as I want to have it at home. About $12.50 for my huge Chai tea and curry chicken sandwich.",11,15,5,8,"Positive","4"
"568","LtjtyM0CcVWBNRJ-mfsC_Q","4","I've gotta say, Nordy's (as my aunt refers to Nordstom since it's her favorite department store ever) is always a safe bet if you're looking for quality selection, customer service, and a very pleasant shopping experience.  Whether you're looking for shoes, lingerie, cosmetics, apparel, etc... you'll likely find it at Nordy's.

I'll have to take Samantha O's and Julia T's advice and remember to go to Nordstom's next time I need a new bra.

In the meantime, I've gotten lucky with shoes, all kinds of clothes, accessories, and perfume.  This weekend is a big sale.  I ran in earlier to return something and walked out with a new pair of shoes.  Oops.  Take that as a warning, Nordstrom can be dangerous for shop-a-holics.

The only times I have not gotten lucky at Nordstrom are when I've been on a mission for something specific - such as Converse Sneakers in Jared's size 7 or a certain shirt or bathing suit in my size.  But I'll overlook these times and return again and again... Keep up the good customer service and selection, Nordy's - and I'll be a customer for life.",7,8,4,1.5,"Positive","4"

I enjoyed my handmade ravioli with spinach and yummy cheese (not fish yay!) filling and the wine and the mouse.  It was good!! 

But then something happened....my date gave the server his card to pay for the meal and it was brought back as not able to be processed (yikes!).  The server also informed him that they'd been able to process someone else's but one other didn't go through.  My date checked his account on line and it had plenty to cover, but had just enough cash to cover the tab, not really enough for a tip.  So he asked the server if they would try to put a lesser amount on the card to cover the tip and take the cash.  This is when the server informed us that the machine might be down and it wasn't just his it was everyone's! So he kinda lied earlier, which wasn't cool.  We then waited another 30 minutes without an appearance by the server to explain what was going on, although I could see Marcellino working on the machine, even trying his own card.  My date got up to go speak with him, and the server tried to divert him, but he was respectful and wanted to speak with the owner.  No attempt was made to really apologize for the delay or make up for the wait...so they wrote down his information and address to mail him a receipt.

How do you get 3+ meals, you might ask? PACKING & SMUSHING! First, add some meat, and use the wax paper to pack down the meat all along the sides and the bottom of the bowl. Try to avoid empty spaces in between every piece of meat. Then add your vegetables, and smush it all down with the wax paper with each layer of veggies you add. Make sure to add enough meat and veggies so that your have a flat surface up to the brim of the bowl. Add lots of green onions for extra flavor.

I recommend using the wheat noodles, because you can create a taller mountain of noodles and it's healthier!

Advice for the sauce: ADD LOTS OF IT. Since you're now a packing queen/king, you can't use the recipes on YC's wall, either double up or triple up.

Ask the nice Mongolian BBQ chefs to add pineapples and cilantro, and then when they finish cooking up your food, add some sesame seeds for that lil extra somethin somethin!",2,3,2,2,"Positive","4"

As a matter of fact, I don't really feel comfortable in Neiman's - it's extremely 'fancy' and high end for me.  But, I've gone in a handful of times and even bought a dress or two on sale at Neiman's in the past.  I admit, the quality associated with the designer labels at this store is pretty amazing.

Anyways, I felt some major pressure to register at Neiman's from my mom, so I met my mother-in-law-to-be at this Neiman's location on Sunday.  The housewares / registry department is extremely small... and although the woman working was sweet, she botched the spelling of Jared's name in the process.  Needless to say, i was not so impressed.

"597","3zMROSt7HNbyq7Lp-MzaWA","4","I used to live off this place. They cut their meats and cheeses fresh like a real deli, so already it kicks the shit out of Subway, Quiznos, and every other fast food deli chain that offers up pre-packaged meats. Their bread and cookies are fresh as well. For some reason, this location has better tasting food than any other Port-o-Subs I've been to. Don't know why.

There's always a long line at lunch, but it moves fast. There's some good people watching to be done here - cops eat here, firemen eat here, doctors and nurses eat here, and you also get the entire spectrum of downtown Scottsdale folk... sometimes you would think you arrived at a costume party or they are filming a new Village People video. I don't know what it is and I don't know that it matters either, but good looking people eat here. Whatever you want to make of that... 

Most of the people that work here are really nice and competent. They keep this place pretty clean as well. Once I noticed some fruit flies buzzing around by the soda machine and was told they sometimes come with the fresh fruit they get for the smoothies (which are fantastic). Outside of that, I can't complain about this sub shop and I eat here all the time... it's almost just about as good as a non-chain place.",3,6,4,7,"Positive","4"

They were able to accommodate my desire to skip the fruit and veggie sides and go all waffle fries for me.  When I asked for dipping sauces beside ketchup, I got three choices.  I would only complain that their water glasses are far too small, especially for some of their spicier dishes.  I think the expectation is that you have cocktail to help you wash away some of the heat.  Speaking of their cocktails, the martinis, which I have had on a different occasion, are quite good.

Andiamo....

FOOD
--------
Appetizer: Fritto Misto, which is a trio of fried appetizers. For the day, ours included a cheese, a stuffed olive, and whole leaves of broccolini. The cheese wedge was great (I wish I remembered what it was), and have you ever had a deep fried veal-stuffed olive? Very interesting. The flash-fried broccolini took a little getting used to, since the leaves kept crumbling as I was trying to eat them, but still tasty, if subtle.

Main: Orecchiette alla Puttanesca. Man. This is the real deal. Orecchiette is the ""little ear"" pasta and ""alla puttanesca"" means it's made ""whore style"". 

And what a beautiful, classy, yet very vibrant whore she is.

The pasta was cooked just perfectly, and even though puttanesca sauce usually goes with a stringier pasta (spaghetti, linguini, etc.) it worked really well with the orecchiette. 

And the sauce. Holy mother, this streetwalkin' hussy of a sauce with its 12 ingredients: capers, breadcrumbs, anchovy sauce, garlic, olives, basil, olive oil, and, uh, the other 5. The flavors were a perfect, clear-heeled harmony. Nothing overpowered the other. Subtle and humble home food. It really tasted just like something my Italian friends' mothers would cook in their kitchen.

As for the servings, when I first got my bowl I was thinking, ""oh ok, this is a European serving. I'm still going to be starving after this."" And, um, nope. Why? Because I slowed down. I savored my meal, and took my time with the dish. And by the end, was I hungry? Not at all. I really enjoyed this meal. And the serving was just right. Complimentary packs of long breadsticks are also found on each table. 

SERVICE
-------------
Very friendly, efficient, and willing to go through the menu in detail and answer any more questions about the restaurant. Dishes were brought out in a timely manner and there was never any rush after the meal was completed to clear the table. 

And the mood inside Pastabar was palpable. Everyone looked happy, excited, and relieved that the restaurant was finally open for business. And I felt the same for them. 

SETTING
-------------
I would say the space was just the right size. Not a cavernous place in the least. Probably the same size as Sens, maybe  even a little smaller. It's tucked away in the very back of the hallway of the building, so much so that I completely missed it when I was IN THE HALLWAY the previous afternoon looking for it. But I like it a little hidden off, actually. 

The colors inside are warm, with a modern bistro feel. No windows looking outside but I didn't mind that. There is seating at the bar, a few two-tops up front, and larger tables in the back. Selections from different Shins albums made up the soundtrack throughout the dinner, and while the music sounds like it could be incongruous with a bunch of little ears cooked whore-style, it worked. 

I definitely don't think this is going to be as ""scene-y"" as Sens. It has a completely different vibe. 

EXTRA CRIB NOTES
-----------------------------
* the main courses of Pastabar are pasta and ONLY pasta. No veal parm here. And no hoikey sauces like Olive Garden-y alfredo or a jar of sugary Prego.
* It's great
* Prices for antipasti range from $7-$11-ish and mains $11-ish to $18. I spent around $26 with tax and a nice tip.
* it's great
* No liquor license (yet). For now, sparkling waters, lemonades, a number of sodas (including root beer & cream soda). 
* it's great
* complimentary valet awaits the diners, if you're averse to parking close by yourself.
* it's great
* It's open till midnight on weeknights and 2 am on weekends! What more could you ask for?
* did I tell you it's great?

ALL IN ALL
---------------
An awesome asset to the area and I'm very content. And as much as I loved my whoreish little ears, all the other pastas on the menu sounded incredible and I can't wait to try them all. 

I'm wishing these guys much success and giving them gratitude to finally being open. A few minor kinks to be worked out (and I wasn't as into the appetizer as I was my entree) so it's not totally perfect but they have started out very strong, and it's only Day 2.

They have a great and fairly affordable lunch menu with lots of options, including lots of vegetarian options.  I also really appreciated that my waitress went back and checked with a vegetarian staff member to see if the tomato soup had meat stock (it didn't, but minestrone did).

I got the pasta with the soup or salad combo with this delicious Mediterranean pasta - olive oil, feta, pine nuts, tomatoes and red peppers.  The pasta itself was surprisingly bland, but with a hint of salt and pepper, it was pretty tasty.  The bread that it came with was also delicious, all on its own.

Our first experience with the new management and staff wasn't great.  Service was slow, but we figured they must be busy so we let it slide.  Then we bought stuff from the market.  They have two registers side-by-side--one for the market purchases and one for the restaurant bills. We went to the restaurant register so we could pay for our market purchases along with our meal.  First of all, we got ignored and had several customers taken before us, despite the fact that we were there first.  When they finally decided to acknowledge us, they told us we couldn't pay at that register since we had a market purchase.  Rather than just sliding over to the next register and taking care of the purchase there, they made us wait in line again.  Finally we checked out...and were overcharged.  We didn't realize this until we got home and by then it wasn't worth going back. 

We decided to give them another chance and went back a few weeks later.  This time the service was even more slow. 15 minutes passed before we even got our water.  45 minutes later our food still hadn't arrived.  The waitress kept speeding by our table and ignoring us.  We snarfed our food down fast when it finally got there since we had to get back, and went to pay.  Long wait again as we got ignored for other customers who came after us, and then they overcharged us.  Again.  Fortunately we caught it this time.  They hastily made the correction, without so much as an apology.  Rather, they acted annoyed that we were holding them up.  How about getting it right the first time if you don't want to do it again? 

So that was it.  I don't think we'll be going back.  It's really a shame, because the food is  delicious and this used to be one of our favorite places.  It's just a shame that the new staff sucks.  I can get good food elsewhere and not be treated like garbage and overcharged.",0,0,0,1.5,"Positive","5"

The *only* reason I'm giving the restaurant two stars instead of one is the food. Their rindsroulade was very good, and the red cabbage and spaetzle were excellent. But the quality of the food was undercut by the poor service. It was bad enough that I wouldn't return, and certainly wouldn't recommend it to anyone else. As others have noted, there was no-one to greet or seat us -- not even a sign saying ""seat yourself"". Our waitress took a LONG time to make it to our table to take our drink orders, and when she did, she was complaining about something and looked put-out in general. When my wife ordered a beer, the waitress told her that it would be more expensive because it wasn't available on tap. Now, that could be useful information, but the manner in which she told my wife was defiant rather than helpful. Believe me, we gave her no reason to be so sour --  it was clear that this particular waitress was clearly unhappy -- whether with her job or life, it's hard to say. It's too bad, really, because the food *was* good. But why would anyone want to eat at a restaurant whose workers are either nowhere to be found, or miserable? Not me.",0,1,1,0.5,"Positive","4"

Just came back from a week in Maui, so I was still in ""Hawaii-Mode"" (which is soooo hard to get out of lol), so I insisted we go to Hula's to get my Hawaii fix.  Mainly....that just means I was dying for a good Mai Tai.

If you go here, you MUST order a Mai Tai.  While most of their drinks are pretty good and tropical tasting, the Mai Tai is the best in town (now that Trader Vic's is donzo).  I'm a Mai tai snob, and cringe when most mai tai's here on the mainland are made way way way too sweet and fruity.  The Mai Tai at Hula's could rival some of the best in Hawaii in my opinion.  Mostly rum (white and dark) and just the right amount of sweet mixed with the right amount of tart/sour.  They go down great and they hit you with quite the kick before ya know it, so be careful ;-)!

As far as the food...its good, but its not Roy's so don't except anything amazing.  I usually get fish here, just to go with the whole Hawaiian thing.  Most of the times I've had Mahi, it can be dry sometimes, but always tastes good.  Ive had both the wasabi crusted and the macadamia nut crusted, both are decent.  The Luau Pork plate is darn good, but my recommendation is get the Luau Pork sandwich instead.  It goes so much better on bread, than just by itself.

It turns out, today was the first day this adorable little popcorn/candy shop was open... so lucky me, I get FTR (first to review)!

Kim Brush, the owner, was front and center, and welcomed me as I walked in.  She also had a team of people working there that I assume were all training.  They were friendly although it was obvious that I was one of the first customers, so it took longer than necessary to package up my small bag of kettle corn.  The customer before me appeared to have been waiting awhile on her large bag of Puppy Chow (which looked pretty amazing).  The kettle corn I ordered was just the right balance of sweet and salty.  I had to dig deep to exercise my self-control and not demolish the entire bag in one sitting!

I took a menu to go as well, and now as I look at it, I can't wait to go back to try more of the unique gourmet popcorn flavors.  Not only do they have the basics (Buttery and Low Salt), but they have all kinds of savory flavors including several different cheeses, Dill Pickle, Salt & Vinegar, and Southwest Jalapeno.  If you're more of a Caramel person, they've got you covered as well, and of course there are a rainbow of Fruity Delights and Decadent Chocolate flavors too!  Popcorn Bags come in all sizes from Mini to Party and range in price from $1 to $149.95.  You can also order tins, boxes, and/or pots of popcorn and this place ships anywhere in the U.S.A.

Sprinkles is sooooooooo not worth the wait . Or the chaos. Or the hype. Or the attitude from the morons who work there. Other things that are terrible about Sprinkles include...

- The cupcakes are not that great. I ordered two. The vanilla was okay, the cinnamon was dry and chalky and I really disliked it.

- This place is a disorganized mess. 

- There is no rhyme or reason to any of the ordering process. My friends and I were carefully watching the ordering process and we actually think they decided to choose the dumbest and most irrational methods to take orders and dispense cupcakes. Just stupid.

- The owners must have purposely only hired people who cannot think for themselves or make decisions. No sane person could possibly work here without being like ""um...there might be a better way to do this...""

- Also, the employees were rude. Did I mention dumb?

I pointed out that the water was RIGHT THERE and there wasn't anyone currently paying or using the register. Couldn't she just sell me a water? She said ""NO"" and proceeded to WRITE DOWN MY ORDER (just the word ""water"") on a cupcake order slip. She then told me to stand there and wait for my name to be called so she could HAND ME THE WATER and then ring me up.

I was all sorts of thirsty and all sorts of moody that day so I got really ghetto on her ass and was all like OH HELLLLLL-TO-THE-NO!""

Endless options of different broken rice (aka com tam= deliciousness)  dishes which typically include shredded pork and whatever type of meat flavors your fancy, all within your $6-10 wallet budget! Service is prompt and efficient, menu is ez to follow, focus your energy on the broken rice dishes; thats what theyre known for. 

I highly recommend the shredded pork + pork chop + steamed egg combo that comes with a light pork broth on the side. The portion is HUGE and each component of the dish is so flavorful and unique, bringing together a fantastic symphony for your palate. My personal favorite is the steamed egg; there's just something about the soft and moist texture that compliments the broken rice. Go easy on the fish sauce (ngoc mam) they give you on the side (try adding Sriracha to the sauce to add some spice in your life), the dish is by far no means lacking in flavor/sodium.

This place is definitely a great spot if you need a quick lunch, and you are on the go. Its a fairly comfortable place to eat, and it's better for you than a Baconator (although, that does sound delicious right about now).

They tend to water down their Sriracha, but it might be more of a heat thing rather than a cost cutting thing. Sriracha can be a bit spicy for some.

They're always running a deal, so look for one before departing.  One year we did an annual pass.  It was a good deal.  There are also lots of special events that include deals.  One time we met spiderman.

There are lots of rides, mostly for shorter kids.  Some have modest height requirement that exclude the very young and some that exclude the tall.  There's a train, carousel, mini-coaster, tea cup ride, an up and down parachute ride, several rides that go in circles in different vehicles (e.g., planes, cars, and helicopters and futuristic flying machines), and a bumper boats ride that turns into a splash pad in the summer.  Determining whether the adults need a wrist band or tickets is always a little tricky as adults are needed on some rides, but not others, and it also depends on the age of the child.  The place has a little bit of a rundown feel, but kids don't notice and have loads of fun.  The arcade is really rundown, but the ATM is really nice.  There isn't much shade, so be prepared.  All of the staff are really nice.

We were at the Ulta just around the corner and she said she was hungry and she LOVES pizza.  We have been here twice as of this writing.  The second time around was ""Kids Eat Free"" night.  That is Wednesay for those of you with kids and it's a good deal.  I will eventually put together a list of Kids Eat Free places in the area.  For now let me tell you about NYPD.....

The pizza is a winner!  Nice crust, great topppings!  They use paper thin slices of sausage instead of hunks of sausage.  The flavore is great too.  My daughter had a slice of black olive pizza and they were very generous with the olives....she loved it!  I have had the ceaser and the house salads and both were good and fresh.  

So for the Kids Eat Free night adults need to order an entree (I think this includes a whole pizza too, not sure though) There were several things to choose from including cheese ravioli, baked ziti, and  lasagne.  I chose the lasagne and it was delish!  Piping hot with melted mozeralla over the top, I could not stop eating it!!  The flavors melded together nicely and it reminded me of my Mom's lasagne.  And did I mention the bread......OMG!!  The little ibites of heaven are sooooo good!!  I could have eaten ten of them!!  They are homemade, the real deal, yeasty goodness!!  Warm and just a little chewy, the flavor was amazing!!  
Oh and the Desert Flower Ice Tea.....so refreshing!!!  I keep thinking about it, that's how good it is!!

Try the canollis.....you won't be disappointned.  Kids get an ice cream sundae with their meal.  On our first visit Lori, our server, was a real sweetheart.  She gave me some coupons and signed me up for the email list.  And on our next visit , Jessica was awesome and attentive too!

This is a small place but they also have an outdoor patio with misters.  The bar is tiny, probably seats 10.  Flat screen for watching the D'backs and some good beers on tap, along with Happy Hour specials makes this a great place!!  This will be somewhere we will frequent!!

She is, of course, born to Vietnam and world traveled. 

Let's start with my happiest aspect about HKGB: the sushi. No, it's not the best sushi in the Valley, but they make it fresh for you on site. You can stand there and watch it being make, grab a soup or something else to munch on, or just sit at your table and chat awhile. Afterwards, you can head back for more sushi or veer over to the more traditional offerings of a Chinese buffet: sweet and sour chicken, fried rice, crab legs. 

Now let's review the not-so-shiny aspect: the price. Yes, it seems a little steep that we paid about $25 per person with tip (and I made only two rounds) but when you factor in the 2 hours we spent there, grazing, catching up, grazing, passing Lisette's daughter around, grazing and making plans to keep in touch, it's really not such an outrageous amount to pay.

I stand here naked as the day I was born
Face to the dawn and my faith in the song
Blood soaking the pages I painted em' on
And none of ya'll will take my place when I'm gone
I'm the pure raw uncut, who the fuck want what
Here to show you sucker ass mutts what's the fucks what
Brother Ali vow solemnly not to die while the music is still inside of me
It's got to be allowed to breathe
Got to let it out enough at least to let the monster flee
I want more than what your offering me
Songs that make me feel like I'm already free
I'm a rebel in my own right
Ya'll don't want to write or think or speak a rhyme standing next to me
When the game need it I'm exactly what it need
Put the soul in the speech, let it go, let it be

Not nearly a single solitary soul
Still put the kind of passion to the mic that I hold
One day it'll have to be pried from my cold dead hand
Until then the big man is gold

Climb into the zone of the evening, keep reaching
Just to pull more out the core of the deamon
The people need to see them pure human being
Blood, sweat, love, hate, life, death, joy, pain
Little child running wild striped to the raw veins
Rugged junkyard dog off the chain, barefoot balls out marching in the rain
Sacred war dance suspended in the moment
We throw the fuck down like our lives depended on it
Jaws of the streets with our heart on our sleeve
Throwing shots at the law which is all I believe

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 3:]
Our songs are supposed to be the voice of our soul
Not bought and sold, not all controlled
Bring a little fire when the world get cold
Let me shed a few tears and to me you went gold
People need more freedom
Children need to hear more truth when ya'll teach em'
Damn I want to hear a plan from the dude preaching
Got new seeds with true needs and who's leading
I truly believe every word I've ever uttered on a drum break
Right or wrong, life go on but it wasn't nothing fake
I demand you start listening to the crowd
If not - we gon burn this bitch to the ground

Very friendly service, on the other hand. Given that Phoenix-foam tends to be subpar, I tend to think that service and atmosphere are almost more viable measures for successful coffeeshops than coffee. (in Phoenix) 

The actual place was pretty odd. Large paintings of Mexican sugar skulls in the back, nice chairs and tables, an orange faux-finish on the walls... And then the video bar element.

I go to a restaurant for the food first.  As long as it is clean, and Lulu's is, then sitting in, what looks like a used McDonalds booth, doesn't bother me a bit.  Afterall, it's a taco shop!
I like the fish tacos (the small ones) and I usually order 3 of them.  I like how they are made and it reminds me of what you can normally find in Mexico, not at these chain restaurants.
The Ceviche tostada is really good too, but is difficult to eat, so don't wear your sunday best.
Not in the mood for fish, then try the carne asada tacos or any other kind for that matter.

Lulu's is a great place and a break from the Americanized Mexican Food, we see everyday.

Asian food is always good, and the gentlemen behind the line can do custom stir fry for you.  Italian station has fresh pizzas, that once again are made fresh for you, or order a custom calzone like I do.

Let me start by saying, I'm not really a gourmet pizza lover.  As a teacher, I have plenty of Domino's and Pizza Hut all the time, and can be quite happy with that, either that or I love a great slice of New York style pie.  

Since I am not a huge fan of gourmet pizza and the overabundance of toppings, I checked the menu for a nice plate of delicious pasta.  I was incredibly unhappy to find that they had about 6 pastas and they all sounded bland and/or too strange to order.  Then, I found their sandwich section.  I decided on their Spicy Chicken sandwich that sounded perfect.  But it took awhile for our waitress to come over, so I glanced at the pizzas and found a couple that sounded good too.  Thank goodness I did, because as I ordered the sandwich, the waitress informed me that they only serve the sandwiches at lunchtime!  What?!  That really peeved me off.  What is irritating is on the menu there is a clear line between the section that says ""Lunch Specials"" and where it says ""Sandwiches.""  I mean, there is an actual black line drawn between the two...to me, that says that they aren't a part of lunch.  Don't you think?  

Instead I ordered the Popeye and Olive Oyl pizza, which has a white garlic sauce, spinach, artichoke hearts, garlic, Kalamata olives, carmelized onions, mozarella, Roma tomatoes, and Applewood smoked bacon.  After I ordered it, I really thought how I truly didn't even want it.  I was really irritated.  

My husband and I both ordered our own pizza since we couldn't agree on what we wanted, so he got The Vortex, which basically had all the meats you could possibly think of.  For an appetizer we ordered the garlic cheese bread, which was way too garlicy.  It came with olive oil for dipping...I would have preferred some marinara sauce or something.  After I had ate the bread, I really didn't want my pizza b/c of knowing that it had so much garlic.  I picked a lot of the garlic cloves off along with most of the other toppings...there was just too much on it.  I know for some, they would probably like that...but it just isn't my thing to have too much on my pizza.  

All in all, the pizza was pretty good, once I picked off half of the toppings.  The crust was really tasty and had the perfect crispiness and softness to it.  I could have had just had that alone and been happy at that point.  

My husband and I both agreed that it won't be a place we go to again, unless it is for lunch time, so I can try the sandwich my mouth had actually been watering for.",0,1,0,6,"Positive","4"

The boyfriend and I went to MADCAP last weekend to see their Chuck Jones presentation. Unfortunately, we were pretty disappointed, not that it was completely MADCAP's fault but still.

My biggest problem with MADCAP is the price of admission. $10! That's more than a new movie. Why should I pay $10 to see a movie that I could get on DVD for half the price? I know the money is going to a bigger cause - having a cool theatre in town - but I just wish it was cheaper. If it was $5 I think I would go a lot more. For $10 it has to be something I really want to see and after not being so impressed by the Chuck Jones things I'm a little wary.  There wasn't even a screen in the theatre - just a white wall.

The staff were very friendly and helpful, being from the Atlantic Northeast I have high expectations when it comes to Italian done well with personality to boot. I did not want to wait till I got home to eat my so good smelling prize so I went outside to find picnic style tables and benches.  It was way to hot to sit outside and I was craving iced coffee so I went next door to Lux and was both surprised and relieved to find many of their patrons with Pane Bianco bags openly eating their lunches with drinks from Lux to claim patronage.

My favorite sandwich is the chicken continental,
The toppings on here are pretty fundemental,
You can get something else, I won't be judgemental,
When I give you a hickey I promise to be gentle,
If it's not on your neck it's not accidental,
When I am done it will be something monumental,
Before work, covering up with a scarf is detrimental,
Back to my review the rest is experimental.

We found Thai Basil over a year ago now and have been loyal customers, going at least once a week and sometimes more than that, since last July. Everyone who works here is super friendly, and they know us now and know what we like to order by heart. We just walk in now and they see us and say ""Spicy noodle, tofu, hot, right?"" Its pretty great having a place that knows my regular order. I have tried most of the menu items. The garlic eggplant is also pretty great. The thai basil is also amazing. I have generally liked everything I have had here except the curry. I never have had a good curry experience. Both of the times I ordered it I ended up with long black hairs in it (which they quickly replaced with a new order) but I just wasn't a fan. Maybe it's because of the coconut milk and it makes it too sweet. 

The spring rolls are also the best here out of every spring roll I have had anywhere. 

Before I went vegan again last year we also got the fried banana ice cream pretty often. That is pretty amazing. If you eat dairy, you have to try it at least once.

I ran the plan by my father, checking to make sure that would be an appropriate Father's Day dinner.  I received a confused look and thumbs up.  He's not the most adventurous when it comes to dining experiences, but is generally a good sport.

If my friend and I had been on the ball, I could have been eating here for four years.  Granted, I rarely have business around 19th and Greenway, but I could have made Chino Bandido my business.

This is one of the two places with good dogs I frequent that are like a block away from me. I go here if I want something unique, they go for a mix of sweet and spice here, and it works. I recommend the sweet and spicy dog, the sunset dog, and the spam sliders Maui style. Whatever I get I usually make it a meal with tots and either red cream soda or green tea.

On my visit today they were giving away free samples of chicken wings with every meal. I liked the crispness of the skin, and once again the sauce was a nice mix of sweet and spicy. If (when) I order them in the future I'm going to ask for extra sauce though. The only thing I've had here that I wouldn't get again is a burger with chili on it. The thin chili is fine on a dog you're going to eat with a fork, not as much in a burger.

Today I went with a friend. The festival has grown by blocks now. It's pretty big, I think they claim 400 vendors! That has to include the food vendors. 
I had my fry bread taco. It was super good and $9 bucks. I looked for something to buy but left with nothing. The things I liked most were huge home items and big ticket prices. I saw a few handbags of interest but not within my budget either. It use to be that this festival would have jewelry, matted photography and pottery a college student could afford. That's still my budget this year, unfortunately - but such priced things could not be located here this year. So I'm disappointed with the festival offerings. 

Parking covered & uncovered was $10 if you could not find free street parking. There wasn't enough ice cream vendors in my opinion but there was plenty of food vendors and the neighboring eateries were also busy and offering variety.

We expected a counter-service experience but were pleasantly surprised when we entered to find it was an actual sit-down restaurant.  The vibe was a classy yet laid back, youthful feel.  Most of the servers were high school or college age and wore regular street clothes (think Urban Outfitters style).  I loved the laid back atmosphere of the servers even though it's a sit-down experience and really enjoyed the color scheme and tin plated ceiling.

The food was absolutely FANTASTIC.  Oh my. For an appetizer we selected the garlic dip with two pitas.  The garlic dip is a mix of olive oil, lemon juice, fresh garlic, and smashed potatoes.  If you love garlic, you'll love this.

My husband chose the Falafel Pita which was topped with cilantro and spices, mixed greens, tomatoes, onions, pickles and tahini.  He was very happy with his choice, although next time he'd ask for no onions.

The service was very friendly and the store was clean, cute, and colorful...but the food was very disappointing. My husband ordered the curry chicken, and although it tasted okay, he literally almost choked on tiny bones in the meat 4 or 5 times. I asked ahead of time if they used white meat and was told yes, but the ""Calypso Pasta"" I ordered had tiny, tiny pieces of dark meat jerk chicken...instead of the boneless white strips I was expecting, and really it was just mediocre.

I showed up today (Sunday) and was a little thrown off by all the people at the bag drop wearing football jerseys. Especially when the people wearing jerseys were the ones grabbing my clubs and putting them in a cart. Thought I was at Buffalo Wild Wings! 

I thought this was a very nice course but the reason it didn't get 5 stars was because it just didn't have that top notch feel that other Troon managed properties have. The greens were very inconsistent; some really fast, some really slow, and some were bumpy. The grass on gold was extremely long and it was very easy to lose your ball in the rough because the grass was so deep. Blue was cut much better but I had a couple complaints with holes 7 and 9. If you're playing the blue course in the late afternoon, you might as well close your eyes while teeing off at 7 and 9 because the architect made the course so you look directly into the sun. 

I sneaked on today for $44 bucks and was very satisfied with what I got for the price. If I didn't live 15 miles away, and could always get on for $40 I'd probably golf here a lot more. If the green fees are above $50, I just couldn't justify it with all the other nice options around the valley. 

On a final note, I was EXTREMELY impressed by the staff and how friendly they were. I was not only asked how my round of golf went, I was also told how glad they were that I came out, and finally that they really hope to see me again. Definitely don't get that kind of service too often!",0,0,0,2.5,"Positive","4"

This morning I was hungry for breakfast and had a lot of things to do so I thought I would try something close. I have noticed the parking lot is usually full, so I thought it must be good. I had no idea what type of food they had or what to expect.

It was Sunday morning just around 9:30 and I was fortunate to be able to walk in and instantly have a table. The server was very friendly and she checked back often always refilling my coffee. The menu is a little newspaper and it's a bit overwhelming with many options, but I finally settled on the volcano. It is described as three pancakes, 2 sausage links, 2 bacon strips, and an egg. The pancakes are three different sizes and stacked to create a volcano with the egg on top. It was under $9 and I was surprised at the size of it! I attempted but could not finish it. The big pancake was left uneaten. They do have a smaller option for around $6 and that might be the better way to go unless you have just returned from a month long trip through the jungle or plan to share with someone. 

The server continued to check on me and even offered up a to go cup of coffee. I don't know how I have overlooked this place but based on the experience today, I would put it right at the top of best spots in town for breakfast.

"1422","qqHCqpE3dDnjFG9fA3MSHg","2","I stayed here last month. It's your average motel (since the doors face outside, not a hallway), and the breakfast buffet is okay (scrambled eggs, hash browns, sausage links, bacon, cereal, batter to make waffles,   and toast provided). The walls are REALLY thin, so thin that the guy snoring next door kept us awake all night. 

The room was clean and equipped with a mini fridge (like the kind you'd keep in your dorm room) and microwave, although lacking a safety deposit box. If you want to keep your items safe, you have to bring your items to the front desk, make a list of what you're dropping off, and then sign. I was uncomfortable making a list, so I decided to forgo this process.

FYI if you call the front desk to order you a taxi, they actually order a car service. The car is an unmarked, dark-colored Lincoln sedan. To go to the 16th Street Sports Bar down the street cost us about $10 vs $6 for an actual taxi (which we ended up taking later). We didn't want to drink and drive, so not bad, but just know that the hotels in the area do not order taxis.

My main complaint is that we didn't have housekeeping service the entire time, hence the two stars. We left for lunch from 10:30AM - 1:30PM, returned, but housekeeping never arrived. We left again at 3PM for the rest of the day, and housekeeping, upon arrival back at the room after midnight, hadn't come. I called the front desk for someone to bring towels, but since there was no one to cover the front desk, we had to go get the towels ourselves. I also wanted an extra pillow, but the front desk person couldn't leave the front desk to get a pillow out of the housekeeping room. I thought this was very strange.

I guess for less than $100/night (Hilton resort down the street much more expensive), it's not too bad. I would probably stay here again for the mere fact that the location is conducing to our activities.

The vegetarian plate was massive and everything on the plate was delicious. Next time we'll pay the extra $5 and split one Vegetarian Plate instead of getting two. The pita and hummus were fresh and delicious, however, I find EG's hummus to be a a little thick for my preference and they use a heavy dose of tahini in their hummus.

The layout is a little strange, it looks like you should order at the big window with the kitchen behind it, but you actually order in the back right corner of the restaurant.  The girl who took my order was very friendly and made my fat ass feel welcome there, which is pretty rare these days.  She suggested I do the slider plate, which I did with a side of green chili mac and cheese and cornbread.  It took about 10 minutes for my order to come out, which is probably a good sign that they were at least spending some time cooking something back there.  The sliders were awesome, all the meat was very moist and full of smoky flavor, my favorite out of the three was definitely the pulled pork.  The green chili mac and cheese was also very good, which was somewhat surprising to me.  I was expecting Stouffer's with pickled jalapenos stirred in, but it was far from that.  For being the end of the night, it was very fresh and cheesy.  The only part of the meal that wasn't great was the cornbread, but I don't think you can really do much to cornbread to make it wow you anyway.  I definitely like this better than Honey Bears, and it doesn't even compare to the BBQ joke Famous Dave's.  When I have tailgate this year, Andrew's will definitely be my go to place for everything.

Yea, really odd choice, and kind of uncomfortable to be eating a burger and having Elsa the Cow, with very sad eyes, staring at you while your biting into one of her relatives. Other then that, I feel that they did a good job on the decor. Really nice in fact. 
Now I ordered the Zin Burger, and it was very good. I mean as I was eating it, it was as good as any burger that I have had. As good as Gallo Blanco, and Hula's. Very juicy, flavorful, I liked the bun. It was a 5 star until I stopped eating it. Yep, then it lost a star. How? After I was done, my mouth turned into the Salton Sea. Holy crap, easy on the sodium chef!!! Way too much salt. Now I know what salt does, but overkill. I actually tasted salt for the next hour.  You had me with everything else, just don' t want to feel that I just sucked on a pretzel. 

Only other complaint is the pricing. Like everyone else on here, I think the pricing is all wrong. Especially if your going solo. I mean as a single diner I have to order a basket of fries? I thought Delux was stupid for doing so, why make the same bad move. I also saw most people sharing a burger.

Had about 50 minutes alloted before my Mayo clinic appointment, so I thought a short stack of banana-nut pancakes would get me in and out fast.  I thought wrong.  Staff was friendly enough, but it took at least 10 minutes for the server to finally take my order.  I asked for banana-nut pancakes, but instead of the pancake syrup (not pure maple), I wanted a side of the blueberry compote that usually comes w/ the blueberry pancakes.  Would this be OK?  Server said yes.  The short stack (2 cakes) arrived 15 minutes later, but instead of banana-nut pancakes, these were blueberries, delivered by another server.  My server came by to ask if I needed anything else, heard my complaint, and rushed back to the kitchen to correct it.  I was assured that it would only take 10 minutes to get a fresh batch out, but another 15 minutes went by before the correct order arrived.  Keep in mind, it's already been at least 40 minutes since I sat down.  I only had 10 minutes to spare- not enough to savor these delicious cakes.

First of all, I was organizing a Happy Hour and Dinner for a retirement party that we had on Friday, August 3rd, 2012.  Reading the fine print on the website it did say that happy hour prices were in the bar area, although because it was a party of 30 we could not fit in that area.  One of the attendees called the restaurant and spoke with the Manager which he confirmed that we were going to have happy hour prices. It turns out when we got to the restaurant they thought we were another party for 40 people that booked the spot for happy hour, but the attendee that spoke with the Manager was misinformed and they only gave us one round of happy hour prices.

Second of all, our server was awful.  There were a couple of servers that actually waited on us because there was a table of 10 people.  Anyways, she took wrong orders and did not listen to our needs and was rushed, rushed, rushed.  Then a new person came in late on our table, and she was not even served when she saw her.  We had to track her down. I am sorry but the amount of restaurants that I have been to, this was the worst service ever.  I mean I had servers that actually new who was new at the table and took their order once they arrived.

I ordered full size of fried green tomatoes, 1/2 order of fried okra, and a plate of sweet potato fries.  The server gave me my fried green tomatoes, but gave me full size of fried okra and the sweet potato fries was horrible.  So I had the server take my sweet potato fries because it was awful.  The server took it away without even asking me if I wanted another batch. I don't cook much, but I probably can fry those tomatoes alot better than the restaurant. I told the server I ordered 1/2 size of fried okra, and she said ok and brought it back to the kitchen then she brought the same dish back and said that she will just charge me for the 1/2 size order.  

And lastly, when the server gave us the bill, it was all separate checks and did not even do that right.  The server was putting stuff on the bill that did not even belong on the check.

The espresso was perfect and did not require any sweetener. I also got a blueberry muffin which wasn't very good, perhaps it was low fat or something but I am very picky about pastries anyway. 

My biggest problem with this place is the fact that they do not have a bathroom. Coffee makes me have to pee and when I discovered this and had to walk all the way to the baby gap because the place next door with a bathroom wasn't open yet requiring me to pack up my computer and leave my drink and food unattended, it was a bit undesirable. I know it's a mall type area but it still surprised me for a drink/food place. It does not set the tone for a place to spend a lot of time which may be their intention. Also, I love John Mayer but they played his same songs over and over again. Perhaps mixing it up or putting on a pandora station would be better?

I must say I'm more of a NY style, by the slice pizza kind of guy.  So the pizza did not hit the spot.  Maybe a little too fancy for my palette. (You can take a boy out of the ghetto, but you can't take the ghetto out of the boy, so for me simple food is always better.)  Obviously, there are enough people who like gourmet pizza as this place has amazing reviews, so I'm just one simple man.

The obnoxious fat chick sitting right behind me proclaimed to her friend, ""I'm no longer investing time in men who aren't available!""  Put down the pizza and grab a dry salad and shut up!!  That's not really the restaurants fault though but I did have to endure that convo through the duration of my meal.

Our server was very nice however seemed very rushed and at times we had to wait for refills on water and for the check.  The atmosphere is very romantic outside with light trees and live music.

Very nice that it is located by the Asian market and shops. They have a frequent buyer card you can pick up in the front (for every $100 you spend, you get $10 off your next bakery purchase). This is gonna be in use for me since I can see myself coming back countless times!!

Rolls are of a great quality and there are some rather unusual and pleasantly different ones there. Price is very reasonable. And drinks selection, if not overly excessive, is ""Cool"".

One one of the weekday evenings they have this special thing where you can request your musical choice from this rather large list. Its real neat. What else is neat - their happy hour on Wednesday (I am not sure what day exactly to be honest. Call them if you really want to know.), when drinks, starters and most rolls are 1/2!

The dual menus, one french-ish and one southwestern-ish are sort of on odd pair, but it is Scottsdale. The appetizer, shrimp ""beinets"" were simply breaded, fried and very greasy while the lavender dipping sauce and salad that came along with were much more appealing. Both our entrees were wonderful and perfectly cooked - so well in fact, the sides were essentially meaningless, even though I remember them as fairly good also. So if you find yourself here, keep the Ahi Tuna and the Wild Boar in mind.  The wine menu is extensive and filled with surprises. 

The wait staff were classic in service, yet easily engaged in conversation and very friendly. They only acted snobby for the people who expected it, we on the other hand provided the Diamondbacks/Rockies scores and had a great time! We ended the night with great Grand Marnier birthday souffles.

"1540","C0_XvWKIc6WU7Br95pvcNw","3","I am not happy with Sprinkles, but I can't really subtract stars because I make better cupcakes than they do.  Let me first start with the location.  It's very stupid.  Very easy to miss and it blends in with everything else.  No personality.  I guess when you are so famous though, you don't need ""personality"" to get people in.  Second of all, I hate Scottsdale.  Again, I can't subtract stars for this, it doesn't make sense.

As for the cupcakes, they are really only okay.  I will set aside my disdain for chains and judge solely on the quality of the cupcakes.  I ordered a red velvet and a peanut butter chocolate.  The red velvet was very plain.  It lacked the subtle cocoa flavor and the lovely tangy flavor of the buttermilk that should be peeking through the copious amounts of red food coloring.  It wasn't.  I just tasted red and cake.  Not really that great.  To top it all off, my cupcake crown popped off the second I picked it up.  This pissed me off.  It essentially ruined my first bite.  At least I could still eat it.  The cream cheese frosting was so-so.  I really like a big bold cream cheese flavor to pair with a red velvet, and this was barely tangy.  It was super sweet, slightly grainy and it got that crust on the top from sitting out too long.  The red velvet overall was kind of meh.

The peanut butter chocolate was definitely not what I had hoped for.  The cake was very dense and peanut buttery, but lacking in sugar.  It was studded throughout with chocolate chips.  The frosting was chocolate, and it's texture was nice and smooth.  It was covered in chocolate jimmies, I just love those.  This cupcake was okay.  The lack of sweetness in the cake made me wished it was saltier.  A saltier cake paired with the delightfully sweet frosting would have made for a much more grown-up and sophisticated cupcake.  It was just okay as is.

We were seated towards the back near a group of teenage mothers and their burly counterparts. We ordered food...

The food arrived in a timely manner, it may have been poisoned but i was too hungry to care. I ordered the mushroom/swiss burger.... 9 dollars-ish. If Mcdonalds ever begins selling their products in the frozen food aisle of grocery stores it might taste something like what they serve at The Vine.

We arrived around 10:00 and was told that food would only be served until 11. That wouldn't be a problem at all except that our waitress didn't return with menus until close to 10:30 and then returned to take our orders at only a few minutes before 11. The place had other patrons, but it certainly wasn't so busy as to take an hour to get our orders. Unfortunately, on each of our visits, the waitress was half listening and seemed easily confused

The food itself was quite good. The Shepherd's pie was hot and tasty and the bloody marys were actually perfectly spiced. Neither was worth getting excited about, but they were certainly decent and reasonably priced. 

Considerably later in the evening, our waitress returned with the bill. There was one extra drink on the bill which no one ordered and she was perfectly friendly about saying she'd remove it, but we spent a good five minutes as she kept getting confused about our - apparently - very complicated instructions of ""$20 on the credit card. The rest in cash"" She continually read back excessively complex scenarios, and we kept asking her simply to put twenty on the card, that's all.

When she returned, she had taken $20 of our cash towards the bill, charged $60 to the card and kept the remaining $55 in cash as a tip. That's just shy of a 75% tip she assigned herself. 

We spoke to the manager, who couldn't find her for some time, and when she showed up, she blamed us repeatedly. She finally refunded the card and brought us our new bill, with the extra drink.

It wasn't worth arguing about at that point.

After relocating to Phoenix, he'd been jonesing hardcore for non-commercial, non-fussy sushi in epic proportions served with a smile.  Our trusted source told us that Kyoto was their favorite and we had to indulge.  The mixed views on Yelp made be a tad nervous, but I like to give places an unbiased chance.  Very glad that I did.

The interior of the place is a little strange given the shape of the restaurant and lack of windows, but we made ourselves cozy in a table next to the sushi bar.  I also did not notice a pre-club atmosphere - it was chill the night we went, but maybe it was because we went after work (which is probably on the earlier side for the see and be seens).

No teppan for us that night - it was all about the sushi.  We started with a pleasantly savory miso soup, flavorful seaweed salad and moist, tender tako (octopus) salad.  Next was my favorite dish of the night (and no, not traditional for sushi, but whatever) - a peppered, seared tuna with onion sauce.  Divine!  I could have had three plates of this and called it a day.  Most of the folks in our party ordered rather classic rolls, while I ordered an additional three specialty rolls (Candy Cane, Ichi and Shrimp Tempura - I love to crunch it out).  The rolls were so HUGE we struggled to eat it all.  Keep in mind that those specialty rolls are massive, particularly the Ichi (should have been called Ichi the Killer Roll) which you could barely eat with chopsticks.  I was a mess of dungeoness crab and spicy tuna by the end of the night, but I was happy.

Price was absolutely fair for the quality of the food - there are many (MANY) overprices sushi places in Scottsdale and many dirt cheap places in the valley.  This one charges fairly and keeps the quality up.  I don't ever mind paying if it's worth it.

"1775","EJi2hMav9tkYMnP4JrelUA","4","Known as ""The Jewel of the Desert"" and the ""Grand Dame,"" this beautiful hotel is the only one in the world with a Frank Lloyd Wright-influenced design.  The architect was a man named Albert Chase McArthur, who had studied under Frank Lloyd Wright.  Hence, the main restaurant's name is ""Frank and Albert's.""

Celebrating its 80th birthday this year, this unique art-deco resort is rich in history.  Dozens of presidents have golfed here, Marilyn Monroe splashed around in one of the 8 on-site pools, and many more celebrities and industry magnates have called this their temporary home.

When visiting here, it is important to note that on-site parking is costly.  A self parking fee of $12 is imposed even on its guests, and the self parking lot is often located some distance from the hotel entrance.  For those not wanting to bother with parking the car themselves, the price is$27 to valet.  The package I purchased luckily had the self-parking included, but the car was delivered to the valet nonetheless.  I was sure to speak to a hotel manager about how ridiculous it is to ask a hotel guest to pay for parking, and he happily credited our room for the valet fee.

So, my first experience was our dinner at ""Frank and Albert's"", formerly known as the ""Biltmore Grill.""  Local purveyors provide the ingredients for nearly all of its organic dishes.  From Queen Creek Olive Oil to Shriner's Sausage, Mesa Ranch Goat Cheese to Biltmore grown Rosemary, one can taste the difference.  The menu provided a range of selections from salads, pizzas, and flatbreads, to rotisserie and classic comfort foods.  The wood stone baked filet of salmon was flavorful, tender, and full of tender feelings. I recommend their ""bloody rose"" cocktail.  I snicker as I write these words, because bloody marys are my least favorite cocktail.  However, this unique blend is made with crop organic tomato vodka and juice, fresh biltmore grown rosemary and spices.  Service was attentive and timely, waiter was very knowledgeable, and we were very impressed with the quality and flavor of the food.  

Next, it was on to the newly added wing of the resort, the Ocatilla.  The Ocatilla is essentially a new boutique hotel situated on the Biltmore property.  It has its own pool, a concierge, and an executive lounge which offers daily complimentary breakfasts, a light evening fare, beer and wine, desserts, as well as coffee and soft drinks.Our package included a room on the third floor of this location, as well as access to its executive lounge.  

Although our stomachs were full from dinner, we made room for chocolate covered cheesecake, choc. covered strawberries, fudge brownies, tarts, and chocolate chunk cookies.  We swallowed it all down with some prosecco, and headed up to our room.

The room was at least 500sq feet, and I believe that the rest of the hote has fairly sizeable rooms, as well.  The decor was a blend of art deco and southwestern.  The bathroom with its granite countertops, boasted a tub with sea salts and candle, in which we submerged ourselves comfortably up to our chins.  Two plush robes were there for us to lounge around in.  A snack bar was provided, although a package of nuts and dried fruit was $7.  Biggest disappointment was that that there was no wetbar.  I always look forward to these in any hotel room, especially to use them for storing leftovers from dinner.  The king bed was etremely comfortable, with its pillow-top mattress and feather pillows, as well as the high thread count sheets.  Silky soft...

We enjoyed peace and quiet all night, and were not disturbed in the morning by housekeeping.

The next day were were early to rise to enjoy the lavish continental breakfast spread in the lounge.  Granola with local pecans and yogurt parfait croissans with spinach and boursin, ham and cheese, small danishes, assortmnt of fresh fruits and juices gave us the perfect start to our day.  We grabbed some bottled waters and cokes and headed to the pool.  We had an appointment at the spa an hour later, for seaweed wraps and massages, and it was wonderful, the service excellent and very personalized.

Recommendations:
go to biltmore's website directly to book a room. you will find incredible packages. our package was $200 and included dinner for two, lunch for two, 50% off at the spa, and access to the executive lounge at the ocatilla.

if you live locally, they will shuttle you - saves the parking headache.

About Ocatilla:
basically an upgrade with your stay. For an additional $75-$100/day, these are the following amenities you will receive:
complimentary beverages, wine, beer, breakfast, light evening fare, and desserts in the lounge

By default, this item doesn't include the normal potatoes and toast, so I had them add homefries--they were magnificent, and entirely unnecessary. A huge portion of them, with a wonderful smattering of rosemary to punch them up, they were delicious, but I couldn't finish them.

The girlfriend got a waffle with bacon and it should just be said that restaurants who serve waffles without real maple syrup are simply criminal. Matt's brings the good stuff, and it's MUCH appreciated. Perfect for dipping both waffle and bacon alike. The waffle was fluffy, light, and had that good, homemade flavor.

I can't get over how filling and delicious my sandwich was. Service was prompt and friendly, and overall, it was a great experience. Added a glass of OJ and a coffee to my sandwich with added homefries and her bacon and waffles bringing our tab to right about $21. Absolutely worth every penny. Will be coming back.

No but seriously, I could eat every meal here. Chef Becky is amazing and breakfast this morning did not disappoint. I decided to try the Organic Oatmeal and my friend ordered the Red Velvet pancakes. Ok, so you're probably saying ""with all that yummy goodness you ordered oatmeal?"" Well, what I really wanted were the chilequiles (eggs, cotija jack, pulled pork, tortillas, tomatillo verde? Yes please!!) but being allergic to eggs I went with the oatmeal, which was delicious. The oatmeal had a vanilla flavor to it and the strawberry and pecan topping gave it some texture. The red velvet pancakes are too intense for words. Rich, fluffy...they'll make you want to get up early on a Saturday morning. I also tried a side order of the banana bread which was slightly toasted....now if you've never toasted banana bread, you need to. This was the perfect buttery flavor combination with the oatmeal.  

The service was fast as always--we never had to wait or ask for a coffee/water refill. The decor inside is warm but I think sitting outside on the patio is the way to go.

Let's re-cap 2 of my experiences, shall we?

DINNER:

Arrived shortly after 6 p.m. on a Saturday and sat in the bar area, which was littered with a few patrons. Live music started at 7 p.m. Since Saturday is considered ""All Day Happy Hour,"" I went with a $5 sandwich - turkey, with smoked provolone. On the side, fresh fruit. They call this their ""Half and Half."" The sandwich was okay. Nothing I can't make at my own hacienda, though. I really liked the turkey, which like appeared freshly carved. The beverage: Sam Adams Summer ale, which was their seasonal at the time. 

My family, who dined with me, thought the food was okay. When both my brother and my dad ordered beef, they weren't asked what temperature they wanted it cooked at. They were just given it well done. I would not have stood for that. 

Overall, the food is average ""bar style"" food. The menu is large, though. It may take you several minutes to narrow down your choices. From calzones and burgers to sammies, you have options. 

JUST DRINKS:

Now we're talking. If you're looking for a low-key place to hang for a couple hours, play some pool, watch some sports or hear live music, I would suggest checking out this place. They have two pools tables: one downstairs in the bar area; one upstairs. They also have a video game machine at the bar. (Beware that the pool tables were probably bequeathed to this place. After all, balls disappear. Where did the que ball go? Hmm.)

As for the beer, well... Let's just say they have quite the selection. You may not find your fancy imports here, but you will find some really great beers from some Oregon and Colorado microbrews. For that, this place goes up in rating for me (hence the 4 stars). After all, there's not may low-key places 'round town - especially close to home - that offer quite the array of beers to satiate my discerning tastes. I recommend you try The Great Divide Raspberry Ale, which is made with real raspberries. It's not overly sweet, but it's unique enough that you may find yourself, like me, craving it from time to time. Or, if you enjoy Rogue beer, they do sell the Dead Guy Ale on tap! 

Sure, I list out their beers here, but that'll take up my entire character limit. Let's just say that on their drink menu, THREE WHOLE PAGES are devoted to beer - what you'll find both on tap and by the bottle. 

SO WHY GO? 
Uhm, that's easy. Go for the great beer. (That's the main reason for the 4-star rating.)

If you love good beer, like I do, and want to chill with some friends, while playing pool or listening to some live jams (though the live music stopped at 9 when i went), then check out Boulders on Broadway. You may even find yourself thinking you stumbled through an invisible portal into a 1970's Denver ski lodge. Good times!",3,4,0,5.5,"Positive","5"

Lucia was Beautiful and sweet, and a pleasure to meet, my lunch, however, was not fit to eat. 

I ordered the THE HUMM-DINGER VEGAN WRAP: Roasted artichoke, zucchini, red bell pepper, onion, fresh spinach and hummus with a balsamic reduction drizzle, with a side of fruit and the sun dried tomato wrap. 

Notice it says ""Roasted"", the cashier told me the Veggies were ""Grilled"". Unfortunately, to my dismay, they were neither. 

Everything inside was heated up, by either stove or microwave, I'd guess the latter, and the ""Sun Dried Tomato Wrap"" was thin, doughy and utterly flavorless, not to mention a shocking pink color, which I'm sure was due to being naturally colored with beet juice, but did not help make things anymore appetizing. The fruit was a soggy pile of your typical pre-cut cantaloupe, honey dew mix. 

It was not what I was expecting AT ALL, when I think of a grilled veggie wrap, I imagine tasting all those veggies bursting with flavor after caramelizing on the grill, they had no flavor though. I also did not expect the temperature to be Hot, chilled would have been better in my opinion if the veggies had actually bee grilled that is. 

This lunch to me was less than average and as I sat there will my full plate in front of me I was asked how my meal was, I clearly stated my concerns as I have here and was simply told that it was a ""Best Seller"". 

Lucia did send over a piece of chocolate cake, which was appreciated, but unfortunately missed the mark since I'm Vegan and the desserts aren't. 

Honestly, in my opinion, aside from the market, most of the menu items are anything but healthy.

I've eaten here for over a decade. I've brought friends, college classmates, relatives, and dates here. I lost my dad 3 years ago and I have fond memories of dining here with him. I distinctly remember spilling a Coke all over myself the first time I brought him here. I also remember coming here on my very last day of law school, with a bunch of classmates from Employment Law. The folks here have seen their share of special occasions in my life. Wouldn't be true if this were truly just a 2 star experience. 

I don't think it's fair to nail a restaurant with a bad review based on only a single visit, in most circumstances. Restaurants are run by humans, who are allowed to have a bad day now and then. I've eaten here a billion times. Occasionally something has annoyed me. Most of the time the service is prompt. And those things are true of every restaurant I've ever frequented more than once. At JOTC, even if it's not prompt, it has not even once been unfriendly. There is an elderly gentleman waiter in particular who I especially like. A non-Indian friend I came here with once asked him, ""So, what part of India are you from?"" The waiter look back puzzled and said in his typically mild and hushed manner, ""Sir, I am from Mexico City."" We LOL'd. 

It's #2 on my list of Indian restaurants in the Valley, which is pretty good. Since Tandoori Times is so close by it almost always wins out on a given night, over the past year or so. But the fact remains that JOTC is solidly #2. 

The food is good, by my Indian standards. Samosas: awesome. Chicken tikka masala: very good. I tried the bhindi masala once and that didn't turn out too well. A unique JOTC feature is that dishes are served in very cute, traditional-looking, brass or copper Indian pots. 

Little details like that lead me to say that the decor and atmosphere here probably beat out Tandoori Times and every other Indian place. Simple but elegant, with old Indian art on the walls and cool room dividers thoughtfully placed throughout. The outdoor seating is very pleasant, with heaters to warm you up during winter. The location only adds to the reason to eat here. It's in a cool space next to the Scottsdale Civic Center, a few yards away from AZ 88. It's a solid place to come with a group to eat, drink, and enjoy some good conversation.

JOTC doesn't blow me away (thus only 4 stars), but it needs to be said that if you live in the Valley it is worth at least one visit if you like Indian food, which you wouldn't be able to tell from the other reviews. Judge for yourself.",1,3,0,8.5,"Positive","4"

"1871","oQ3ZMhZD9C4VF6DKX3gkpg","4","Okay, it almost seems a shame to burst the bubble of the positive reviews of this place, but I just have to. 

I'm not an Indian food expert, but I am a serious enthusiast and I've eaten at dozens of Indian places on three continents, not to mention my family being from the vicinity of that area of the world and therefore having grown up on curry and rice and all things spice.

We went here for lunch yesterday (Sunday), thanks to a Yelp/Aloqa recommendation after we'd had a romp at Estrella Mountain Park and were starving. The place was almost deserted at 1pm, with only one other table occupied - fair enough. We went for the buffet. And I have to say, it was simply ""okay"". The buffet didn't have a particularly wide variety of stuff - several items were cheap regulars such as the saag and the dhal - spinach and lentils for the uninitiated. They did have aloo zucchini, never seen that before - tasted okay, about as good as I'd have been able to make it (and that's actually not a compliment). No lamb dishes - disappointing, but unfortunately this is also rare.

Flavorwise, I found it boring and unspectacular. Saag is saag, tandoori chicken is tandoori chicken, except their chicken was very light on the tandoori smoke flavour. None of the food left the slight zing on my tongue that it should have. Rice was okay, but then you typically can't go wrong with cooking basmati (although another reviewer's mileage apparently differed on this count). We had our almost-3-year-old along and he did have a little rice, chicken and beef - it was his first real curry and thus a pretty substantial milestone for us. Then the wife went to get a little kheer and a gulab jamun ball. The kheer was watery but tasted okay - compared unfavourably to the sabudaana kheer at India Palace. The jamun ball was almost completely solid - you had to press real hard with a fork to cut it, normally they're nice and soft and soaked. However, another one I got was normal - so it was just the luck of the draw there. Beef curry was nice, although the first piece I ate was mainly fat - whatever, you get that and I don't mind it. The fried pakoras can normally be cut through with a fork. These you had to saw through with a knife - not great, chewy to the point of almost being crunchy. No samosas in the buffet. The naan was unusual. I've had a LOT of naan before and this stuff was the uncommon kind, not thick and pita-ey but instead a little more like a roti. It tasted very fresh - we had plain and also garlic - and the wife really liked it. Kid did too. I personally prefer the other sort of naan - softer and a little more substance to it, but this one had merit regardless. However, it took at least fifteen minutes after our food was served before the naan arrived.

All up, middle of the road as far as I'm concerned, although the wife quite liked it. Note that this is for the buffet only - we did not have a-la-carte and perhaps the to-order cooked food may have tasted better. I've had better buffets - the best one in Phoenix west of the 17 IMO is India Palace - a wider variety, a lot busier (as a result, I'm sure) and more flavourful food. Admittedly, I haven't tried any other Indian places south of Bell but west of the 17 except for Sutra. Bell appears to have most of them?

I would normally have given this place a flat three stars, but I'm going to give it an extra half and round up for a few reasons. Firstly, the waiter was real nice and very attentive - up to the standard of a typical US chain place, rather than the silent wanderers with the Easter Island statue facial expressions at other buffets who do no more than refill your water and clear your dirty dishes every fifteen minutes or so. He was asking us how we were doing, offered refills of my wife's iced tea at appropriate times etc. Spot on. Next, there's a buffet discount where all kids under 10 are $5 - however, we noticed that they appropriately knocked the price down to $3.50 for us, unbidden and I guess for the simple reason that he was set up in a high chair and obviously only ate 1/4 of a breakfast bowl worth of food in total. Third, the place had nice decor (although I was a bit concerned there were no tablecloths, with my kid banging his plastic sippy cup and spilling sh1t all over the tabletop) and thankfully they didn't have sh1tapple wudda-wudda-waa-waa pretentious bhangra muzak playing in a cheap attempt at making you feel like you're actually in India.

I'd eat here again, but only if I'm in the area and DYING for Indian food. It simply didn't measure up, either buffet-wise or flavour-wise. For first-timers, I can see how they would have enjoyed the experience - clean seating area, Americanized flavours and a good waiter. My experience, however, has been burned in over almost four decades and I've kicked the tyres of more cuisines from this area of the world than I can recount, especially Indian.

I know smoking it allowed on the patio but since it wasn't the only table available AND the rest of us we're eating food I think they should have sat them a little farther away from us.
Our order wasn't right but couldn't get the server to come back so we just let it go.  The food was great!  Had a few items from the small plates and then we had the bacon grilled cheese and the chicken sandwich.  Both very good.

The catering service was excellent and finally at game time we enjoyed watching the DBacks come from behind to beat the Padres. The suites above centerfield have poor visibility because of the size of the ball park.

The decor is amazing- unlike more Chinese places in Phoenix. The walls are a teal blue, adorned with large carved pieces of artwork depicting scenes in China, golden dragons and more. The lights hanging from the ceiling are amazingly ornate. The place looks like its from a bygone era (doesn't help that its in a run down strip mall) but it is clean and charming inside.

The service was great- kind to our 2 yo, and very attentive. The food was the best part- I can't remember the last time I had such good Chinese food, and it's priced very reasonably. We got the Peking dinner for 2 which included the fried noodles, hot tea, wonton soup (with generous noodles, meat, shrimp and veggies, the best I've ever had), a pupu platter with eggrolls, bbq skewers, house wings and those cheese puff thingies (the presentation is pretty cool, too). Next came 3 entree sized plates of food: mongolian beef, fried chicken (can't remember the name) and the Peking fried rice. The meal concluded with incredible little desserts- sort of like eggrolls but filled with banana and then covered with crystalized honey. I could have eaten 100 of them! Adding in a beverage and tax, the meal was only $34!

I've stayed at places like this before across the country, and I can definitely say that this was a very pleasant experience. Everyone has complained about the beds being hard, but I didn't really find this to be the case. I like a firmer mattress, so I guess that's just my personal preference, but it wasn't like sleeping on a campus futon or anything. The towels were nice- nothing fancy, but definitely not the thin washed-out wisps of cloth that you might have expected at other places. The setup of the place was great- it's just like having a little studio apartment. Even had a coffeemaker, and an ironing board, which is strangely becoming a rarity these days.

I have to make special mention of one thing- the pillows, for some reason, were absolutely amazing. My girlfriend and I both agreed (and we're both flight attendants, so we KNOW hotels) that these were some of the best hotel pillows we've ever slept on. Couldn't exactly tell you why, but there was just something about them- proper amount of spring, cushioning, support, punchability, etc. 

If you need to be in Arizona on business, you couldn't pick a better place. The convenience is amazing- you're right near the highway and there's quite a bit of stuff within walking distance.

My last trip I sat down to order a beer at the bar.  The bartender takes about five minutes to get me a beer, despite the bar being nearly empty, as he was too busy for me with his time and focus instead spent flirting with one of the servers.  

I drink my beer and want another.  The glass sits empty for about five minutes while he paces around the bar.  I try on three occasions to get his attention and ask for another.

I feel bad when I leave that he even got the 8 cents from me.  I hope he spends it well.

The server offered to send the pizza back to keep it hot but since it had fresh tomato on it, I didn't want the pizza to be ruined.

This is one of those places where you order your food from a cashier and they give you a number and you choose your seat from one of the 16 or so tables.  There is a nice little patio as well.  There are a couple of tasks you must do before they bring out your order. 
1. Fill your cup with your beverege of choice (Soft drinks and Tea only- no alcohol, hence only 4 stars).  Do get a beverege as the food can be very hot if you like that way-AND I DO!  And because I am a fool thinking it will never be hot enough, I grab a jar of the hot mustard and one of the Hot Chili paste to bring to my table.  You can, of course, choose chopsticks or a fork.  I usually start with the good intentions and select the chopsticks.  I pretend I know exactly what I am doing.  But these never work as I cannot get enough food into my mouth quick enough so I end up with at least 1 fork.
I am impressed how quickly they bring your order to your table.

Scottsdale Stadium :: AT&T Park is like _______ :: Oakland Coliseum.

a) Oakland A's
b) Rickey Henderson
c) Phoenix Municipal Stadium
d) Yankee Stadium

If you answered C, you, my friend are correct.  And you're pretty smart, too.  Give yourself a pat on the back.

Much like Oakland Coliseum, Phoenix Muni won't amaze you with state-of-the-art facilities, breathtaking views or spectacular nightlife nearby.  What you get here is a functional, simple, 40-year-old ballpark that serves its purpose.  The crowds here are much smaller than you would encounter at other parks, but it fits 6000-7000 people comfortably.  Unless you are in the premium infield seats, you will be sitting on the aluminum benches or on the grassy knoll.  Pick your poison, so to speak.

We always get the infield seats, because you can sit 12 rows behind home plate for under $20.  I don't care how bad the economy is, it's a steal!  Even if you sit directly behind home plate, you will most likely struggle to see the tiny outdated scoreboard screen in the centerfield.  

There are no fancy food choices at Phoenix Muni.  If you're not intimidated by enormous wieners, a footlong hot dog might be for you.  Believe me when I say, you will not be able to eat more than two, no matter how much you love hot dogs.  I am also a fan of the little dining area by the left field foul pole.  You can sit there at a table with a giant umbrella, hide from the sun and sip your beverage of choice.  If you're lucky, you can even watch the game from some of those seats.

The people who work here, from ushers to concession stand clerks, are incredibly nice.  They really do want to make sure you have a great time at the game, and it shows.

Parking here is very easy.  For $5, you can park in the lot right across the street.  The lot rarely gets full, and you can always almost find a spot.  I hear there are ways to find free parking if you are willing to walk a little more, but at $5, why would you?  It's important to know, though, that the walk from the lot ""across the street"" from the ballpark will take you about 7 minutes.  There is no crosswalk on the street, and you have to use that ridiculous pedestrian bridge they erected with the sole purpose of annoying most baseball fans.

So, +1 star for great seats, +1 star for cheap parking, -1 star for horrible scoreboard, -1 star for the pedestrian bridge.  A-OK, 3 stars.",2,2,2,7,"Positive","5"

In the case of tires, I have to make an exception. 

You can control the quality of tires you buy and put on your car, but not the quality of construction workers who don't know how to secure their nails, screws and bolts for travel on highways, streets and other local thoroughfares. They're a nefarious bunch for the most part. I'm not for extra taxes, but I'm contacting my local elected officials to institute a tax on all businesses who transport these little metal devils on the streets we drive...and stiff penalties/massive fines if they get caught dropping a load of these on the highway. 

For the second time in a year, one of my tires caught one of the little buggers -- this last one was not a nail or screw, mind you, but a BOLT.  I pulled my receipts from the glove compartment, used Yelp to find the nearest Discount Tire, and called for a tow. 

The replacement certificates I got were $16 per tire (back in NC, but they're good here too), and worth every penny. The folks at this Discount Tire location were extremely nice, and had me in and out of there in about 30 minutes (with no appointment). There is even free water for customers. They were able to fix the tire instead of replacing it, which is fine (as long as it holds). 

Every Discount Tire location I've visited has been great as far as the transparency of what you're getting, the quality of customer service, and the wait. In a town of 4.3 million people and never-ending road construction, I have to recommend the free replacement warranty on your tires, no matter where you buy them.

Minnie and I popped in a few weeks back for a self-serve bath.  I initially called to see if a groomer was in, but they were booked out for weeks.  Doing it myself was actually not only cheaper, but it was fun... and a good bonding experience for me and Min as well.  Sara helped us out and explained our options.  We decided on the ultimate wash which included an extremely efficient shampoo and conditioner, brushes, towels, cologne, etc... It was easy and quick - bonus! Minnie was clean and fresh within 20 minutes or so!

Of course we spent a tad bit more time at the store doing some shopping and I was impressed with the dog food selection, homemade treats, eco-friendly collars and leashes, etc...

When I read the reviews on Chestnut Lane I hustled right on over.  The concept is right on but the execution leaves a LOT to be desired.  

First challenge is getting a parking place and I was lucky.  The line to order didn't look too bad when I arrived so i was feeling lucky.  However, the line took forever to move forward causing the people waiting to shuffle back and forth in a very confined space as there was lots of foot traffic trying to enter and exit.  The woman at the register took each order, processed the payment, and then proceeded to prepare the drinks  and sides for each order.  The drinks are somewhat specialty items and are kind of labor intensive, especially considering that the order line is at a total standstill.  SLOW!  After way too long a wait, I finally was able to order...then the real wait began!  It was a good 25 minutes before my order came up and it was just a TURKEY SANDWICH!  I felt lucky, though, as the woman ahead of me in line was still waiting for her SANDWICH after I had finished mine and was driving away!

Sometimes a long wait is mitigated by the awesomeness of the food.  Well, at Chestnut Lane this is unfortunately not the case.  I mean it was a decent turkey sandwich, but when I saw the almost $16 charge for a TURKEY SANDWICH and ICED TEA I was expecting something fabulous.  It wasn't all that.

I had prime rib that was barely warm and I swear had the flavor of a dry piece of toast! The most bland Prime I've ever had. The ""fresh"" horseradish I requested on the side was even bland.

The ribs were decent and the ""baseball"" fillet was par at best also. 

We went on a Friday night and were 4 of perhaps 20 other people in this huge place! The website reads like its scrumptous. When in fact, the experience was more like waiting in line at the new hot club only to find no one inside!

I went for a late lunch with the Gorgeous Gabi.  
We had the restaurant all to ourselves, it was quiet and comfortable.

I ended up just ordering a salad, it was so hot out (surprise) and I just wanted something light. 
I got a Diet Coke and the Caesar Romero Salad (see pics) it consisted of; mixed greens with cilantro dressing, grilled lemon/herb chicken, fontina, cherry tomatoes and toasted pepitas. 

It was really good, I like the mixed greens in place of the usual romaine and although I didn't taste much cilantro it had great flavor.

Our waitress was not very attentive at all, when she did come around to grab my empty glass of soda she did not ask me if I'd like another, instead she brought me a glass of water.........with a bug in it!

My cousin, her friend, and I walk into the the restaurant and decided to eat in the bar area.  We had a very sweet waitperson, Summer.  She rocked with suggestions and her personality was great.  I had one of their smoothies, just like the one at Cheesecake Factory.  It was good, but I have had better at Jumba Juice.  I ended up having their angel hair pasta, my cousin had a chicken salad, and friend #3 decided that he would just mooch off our plates.  The reason why I hate these types of places is that they give you WAY TOO MUCH FOOD!  Why do they do that?  Especially with people, like me, that learned that they better clean off their whole plate?

I have had numerous irritating experiences at Jerry's.  In a nutshell...
I use red Prismacolor pencils.  I run out and go to Jerry's, they don't have them, don't know if they carry them and and nobody can tell me when and if they might reappear.  Why?  The (seemingly) canned answer is because the order comes from corporate, in North Carolina or somewhere far, far away where there is no phone or email access.  I go to buy Sculpey... OUT!  Same answer as to when it might return.  I need Faber Castell PITT brush tip markers...  OUT!  The same story with some airbrush materials. 
""Come back Tuesday or Thursday or just give us a call and we'll check if it's in...""   
I can walk to Jerry's in less than 10 mins but I would rather go to AZ Art or anywhere else than have to call everytime I need some stuff.  I can go to AZ Art in Tempe and when something is out can order from their mother store and it's there the next day.  

The clerks I have dealt with there are part of my rant.  Of the handful that I have dealt with, (mostly morning and daytime) it seems like they don't really know the store well or give a crap to give some insight on their products or company.
They do have a big store and I understand that there is alot of inventory to know about and be able to locate but that is your job.  It just seems like nobody that I have dealt with there is really keyed in on knowing their stuff.
I spoke to a gal there who was really chatting me up on her recent art night where she painted this huge piece and blah blah blah but when I asked if she knew when they might have more of the brush tip markers she was mum.   ""No clue.""

The staff is friendly, drinks are inexpensive (like $10.00 for 1 beer and 2 vodka/soda), and their food is tasty.  They have a large comfy outdoor seating area if you want to catch some fresh air.

My only complaint about this place is on the weekends they usually have a cover band... not that the band is terrible or anything (i think they switch it up so it's  not always the same band anyway), but they're loud and if you're there to watch a game, forget about hearing anything relating to the game, including the people you are with.  I can see how this could go either way with people since it does add kinda a rockin' environment, which is nice, depending on your mood.

Oh and they have those satellite speaker things so you have this box at your table and you can tune the sound to whichever game you're interested in listening to, not that it matters when the band is playing, but every other time it's cool.",3,3,1,3.5,"Positive","4"

How can you not fall in love with this store the moment you walk in is beyond me. It's like entering that magical fairy tale land your mind goes to every time I start to sing or sit down at my piano.

First and foremost, the staff is extremely friendly, both on the phone and in person. I've spent I don't know how much of their time having them assist me in finding sheet music and they've always been a gem and even gone so far as to go google searches for me while I was there and give me some additional leads. It's just an awesome amazing experience.

Upon entering, I was pleased with the location.  Well decorated, clean, good lighting, ample seating.  I was greated by the hostess, and sat at the bar.  The place was pretty busy, and I was by myself.  I was greeted in a quick manner by a nice server from behind the bar.  I took a moment to review my menu, and decided to skip a full meal and go for some lentil soup.

Now, here is where things get dicey.  I won't hold it against Pita Jungle, but I have to put this in the review.  First, after being seated, I noticed that it was a little toasty in there.  I think they could have turned up the A/C.  I am sure if I had been drinking, I probably would have broken a slight sweat, as it was warm in here.  

Secondly, after I ordered my lentil soup, it took what seemed like forever to get it.  I did not time it with a stop watch, but it took a long time for just a bowl of soup.  Secondly, when I did get the lentil soup, I didn't care for it.  It looked kinda gross and didn't taste all that great.  And, in case you were wondering, NO, I didn't send it back or complain.  I was to tired and didn't feel like being a sourpuss.

The other problem that I experienced, was the server girl brought out my check WAY before I was ever served my food.  I hate that!  At least bring my bill with my food, not before!

The staff is friendly and helpful, and will adjust the spiciness of the dishes to your taste. By far the best option at the Talking Stick resort.

As another reviewer noted, this restaurant is really just a bar with a couple of tables, stuck right off the casino floor. This is definitely not a fine dining spot, with the clanging of slot machines and dead-eyed gamblers shuffling around fifteen feet away. Still, it's definitely worth a visit to Talking Stick. At $10-12 for lunch portions and $17-19 for huge dinner servings, and $25 for a massive platter of oysters, shrimp, crab, mussels, and clams, it's a fantastic value for the quality and tastiness of the food.

The resort sprawls beneath the boulder formations, but you can walk all over on the paths that are well marked. Our room was spacious and clean, with his and hers sinks in the bathroom, shower, tub, king sized bed, and walk-in closet. We were located near the main lodge, and a brisk walk from El Pedregal and the Golden Door Spa. We made great use of the wonderful fitness center and took a few classes as well- yoga, bosu, and water fitness.

We tried both pools during our stay, the spa pool and the main pool. We preferred the tranquility of the spa pool; food and drinks at both locations were exceptional. If you meet Madonna at either pool, ask her to make the ""Madonna Special"" for you. A very refreshing smoothie.

During our stay we ate dinner twice at the Spotted Donkey Cantina at El Pedregal- fabulous margaritas shrimp tacos. Our last night we dined at Rusty's Chop House at the golf club. It was a lovely meal on the terrace with a view of the golf course.

The bruschetta toppings on the combination platter were odd for the most part, with the exception of the traditional fresh tomatoes and basil, which was delicious and worth mentioning. The provolone on the sausage bruschetta was excessive and the overall combination of flavors just didn't work. The pesto bruschetta was SUPER garlic-heavy, even for someone like me who loves garlic. I couldn't finish either of the latter types of bruschetta. 

Onto the main course - pizza. Had the Toscana, which has mozzarella, tomato sauce, mushrooms, and sausage. The crust was burnt and flavorless and the toppings just seemed kind of bland and strangely old-tasting. I mean, not fresh. Weird, I know.

They also feature smaller sized entrees for those who are not looking to get stuffed on greasy messes and feel sick all night.

A particular favorite of mine are the ancho pork empanadas which are fluffy and crispy with a little orange in the pork. They are definitely delicious. Also great is their white pizza featuring sea scallops.

The dining area is bright and cheerful, but the outdoor patio is truly a delight on a beautiful day!  It is serene and is surrounded by a plethora of desert plants and a lovely water feature.

The menu is rather short on items, but long on freshness and flavor.  Many of the offerings lean towards Southwestern style.  I have found my favorites on the menu, in particular, the Hummus Veggie Wrap which is filled to the brim in a healthy spinach tortilla with Tepary bean hummus, tomatoes, roasted red bell pepper, grilled red onions, pepitas, smoked gouda, and romaine.  (I've tried to duplicate this wrap at home with underwhelming success!)  Each sandwich comes with the choice of salad or chips. The portions are hearty.

"2312","8zw-XQNUZMRWMSDXA1nMXg","5","Pizzeria Bianco: Before and After 
Cited as ""the best pizza in America"" in numerous on-line reviews as well as on Good Morning America and as published in, Slice of Heaven, to most pizza lovers the three to four hour wait for a table is so daunting that they push on to a more open table atmosphere for their pizza experience. But to the true pizza enthusiast, Pizzeria Bianco is as much about the experience as it is the food. This place is best known for the owner Chris Bianco, hand tossing each and every pizza pie served every Tuesday through Saturday, from 5-10 pm for nearly 15 years, of which I was one of those fortunate customers. However, early 2010 Chris was forced to retire due to illness and turn over the pizza paddle and oven duties to his protégé of 15 years, Horatio Hernandez. 
My decision to try Pizzeria Bianco for the first time came from a challenge I put upon myself: Find the best food in metropolitan Phoenix. After hearing about Pizzeria Bianco from a friend, I made gourmet pizza my first battle in 2009. I knew about the long lines forming an hour or more before the restaurant opened, and this beautiful fall day was no exception. I arrived 60 minutes before opening and my date went to Bar Bianco to start us off with a couple of pale ale microbrews while I held our place in line. Seeing that there were only about 20 people ahead of us, we assumed we would make the 5:00 seating with no trouble. However, just as we were holding a place for the rest of our party, so were the 20 or so people ahead of us, and when the door opened promptly at 5:00, there were now over 50 people ahead of us. Needless to say we were left waiting another hour since the restaurant seats only about 40 at a time. 
When we were seated at 6:00, the four of us started with the homemade mozzarella, local tomato and sweet basil starter with extra virgin olive oil drizzled all over as well as homemade crusty bread with a dish of EVOO with a touch of balsamic added. We ordered three pizzas, the Sonny Boy providing salami, marinara sauce and gaeta olives, the Wiseguy a sausage and mozzarella taste explosion and the Marinara with Prosciutto di Parma. All three pizzas were piping hot when they arrived, just crisp enough around the edges and loaded with the most amazing flavors your mouth has ever experienced. We left the restaurant without remembering the nearly 3 hour wait and were fully satisfied, eager for the next opportunity to drive to 623 Adams in Phoenix for another ""slice of heaven"". 
And so, after hearing of the departure of Chris from the kitchen, curiosity got the best of me. I had to challenge this place and find out if the changing of the guard made any difference in the wait time, the food quality or the overall experience I had truly fallen for. April 6, 2010 again I ventured down to 623 Adams in Phoenix to see if a Tuesday night or a new head chef had made any difference at all. My date and I arrived at approximately 4:00 pm, one hour before the doors would open. We found a line of about 25 people and looked at each other and said, almost in unison, ""Well, the wait hasn't changed"". 
Bob trotted off to Bar Bianco to find our pale ale, Four Peaks to help pass the time. We caught a glimpse of owner Chris Bianco and I told Bob how I would love to chat with him seeing as I was writing a comparison review, I also wanted to find out who was cooking tonight. Bob stalked Chris into Bar Bianco and asked him if he had any time, would he be willing to take a picture with me and answer a couple of questions. When Bob returned with another beer and Chris Bianco in tow, I was star struck and could barely speak. All I could muster up was, ""Are you cooking tonight?"" To which he replied, ""No, I have Horatio at the oven. I can't cook anymore."" I explained my evaluative writing topic and he assured me the experience would be the same. We took a picture and off he went, back to the bar. 
At 6:15pm, after 2.25 hours of complete social enjoyment we were called to our seats at the bar. We ordered the same items we had enjoyed last fall with the exception of the Marinara. The overall experience was better for me as I got to enjoy personal time with Chris. As for the meal, it was just as amazing as I remembered it from 6 months prior with Chris tossing the pie for every customer. The flavors were exactly as I remembered and the service from the staff was top notch, just like the first time. From the wait to the taste, it didn't appear that anything had changed! 
So what makes for the ""best pizza in America"" and how did Pizzeria Bianco get the tag line? Well, my opinion is flavorful ingredients, a phenomenal social experience, and an owner who lives by what he serves. To Chris Bianco and the Pizzeria Bianco staff, you haven't skipped a beat!",4,5,2,12,"Positive","5"

The place is huge, sporting a bakery (said many times before) with unbelievably dirt cheap pastries (not said as many times before), a little carniceria (not as good as Carniceria Sonora) and a huge dining area.  

The dining area with all its painted mural glory is so goddamn cool that I find myself wanting to just hang out there for hours watching La Primera Division de Mexico on TV and enjoying a nice $2 Dos Equis.  

The food - that's probably the only tougher part.  Keep in mind it's still pretty good, but there are better places in the area for getting your Mexican on food wise.  The potato taco is worth getting because it's fairly unique, but it came out so soggy that I had to eat it with a fork.  I grabbed a couple of the Yelp-Advertised taquitos as well - keep in mind these are not the Circle K, rolling taquitos.  They are literally just smaller tacos, but they were damn good.

I am a 40-year-old woman who couldn't be happier with the care I have received and how I feel after seeing Dr. E for the past year. I recommend Dr. E to all my friends and family and the ones who actually listen have been very happy with their care as well. 

In response to Lisa N., it is possible that you are one of the few people who is immune to Botox and similar products, which is to no fault of the doctor. I too was extremely unhappy with subsequent treatments given by another doctor only to find out that no amount of the toxin would ever be effective for me because my immune system works too well. Ironic, isn't it? 

You should always do your homework when looking for a new doctor, especially when you know exactly what type of treatment you are seeking. For example, if you are simply interested in the HCG diet program instead of overall health and you had been elsewhere for less money then likely that place is a better match for you.

Sometimes it's hard to believe that this kind of place even exists, but its no mirage, the Spotted Donkey Cantina is everything that I had hoped and more. 

Starting with the service, there are details that just go to show how the owners and management are in tune with training of the staff. Everyone we encountered was pleasant, seemingly happy and genuine. 

I have to tell you though, when it comes to eating at SDC, you'll be in good hands, Chef Patrick Bolls hands to be exact. His background includes years working with local chef-lebrity Robert McGrath, which has paid off in chiles. The southwestern influenced menu is well balanced with just a little bit of something for everyone. I mean who doesn't love the addictive crunch of La Canasta Corn Chips ($6)? Along side are 3 different salsas including a smoky charred tomato, a deeply flavored red chile orange and finally a tomatillo green chile salsa. All were surprisingly mild though these seemed more about flavor rather than scorching your face, that'll come later.

The ""Shooters"" ($8) seemed harmless enough. A chubby jalapeno pepper stuffed with cheddar cheese and bacon then encrusted with a coating of tortillas and deep fried. At fist bite your mouth is filled with a creamy spurt of hot cheese followed by the pork-tastic flavor of bacon. Then it hits you, the burn from the jalapeno is scorching but a quick dip into cilantro buttermilk sauce helped cool the flame. 

If you're still trying to cool the flavor induced fire one of SDC many salad choices will do the trick. The Spotted Donkey ""Chop"" Salad ($12) is prepared table side with you controlling the amounts of roasted corn, cucumber, queso fresco, cilantro, warm smoked bacon, and avocado. Then tossed in a luscious jalapeno buttermilk dressing and served with crispy flour tortilla chips on the side, it cools and satisfies. Composed into tidy rows of tortilla crusted chicken breast, avocado, bacon, chopped egg and manchego cheese and dressed in chipotle vinaigrette, the dinner sized Southwest Chicken Cobb Salad ($12.50) was almost big enough to share. 

The center of my universe, at least for a minute, was the char grilled Big Ol' Jack Ass Angus Burger ($11.50). This is a seriously tasty burger, topped with cheddar cheese, caramelized onions, avocado, jalapenos and horseradish mustard, fries on the side. Continuing with the meat parade, a sizzling iron skillet filled with Fajitas ($16) was placed in front of me. While you have your choice of chicken or shrimp, the idea of beef tenderloin mixed with sausage, sweet onions and tomatoes seemed like the hearty choice. Along side are the usual accompaniments like guacamole, salsa, crema and warm flour tortillas, what was unusual were how quickly I scarfed these down, delicious.

And at under $20 it is a steal.  However, I ordered the 8oz filet for myself.  It was cooked properly and tasted good but not memorable.  The individual sauces that you can order on the side were also nothing special.  And yes, the fries were just as everyone on Yelp said they were; good but just like In-n-Out's, but cooked a bit longer.  The sides dishes were ok at best and were a bit on the smaller side.  However, the potato gratin was amazing and better than I have had at any steak place thus far.

While it is less expensive than Mastros/City Hall, I think that for a few extra dollars it is worth going to a better place.  In my opinion, Mastros/City Hall have much better steaks and better/bigger side dishes.  However, J & G does have a better ambiance.",0,0,0,4.5,"Positive","5"

"2457","ZpHwEE5ohvRJhE9-BwMS7Q","5","I want to preface this review by saying that I'm close friends with one of the sushi chef's in training, so we got a seat right at the sushi bar and really had a great opportunity to chat.  That being said, I will review this strictly on the quality of food, since we received some deep discounts due to being VIP guests.  (C'mon now, you know you all get discounts too when you personally know the staff/chefs, so quit your whinin'!)

The quality of the fish was excellent... some of the best sushi I've had in my existence.  The key to getting good sushi is to trust in the chef, and ask them what is fresh, and what they would suggest (omakase style).  

We had a sashimi appetizer platter to start which featured blue fin, yellow tail, o-toro (yes, the good stuff!), and a few other pieces.  Served with fresh wasabi root (not the hydrated green powdery stuff), this appetizer really woke our stomachs and senses.

We had a few different rolls per the chef's suggestion, and all were spectacular (including some off the menu rolls).  The kim bap roll was highly recommended, and the quality was definitely memorable, better than most Korean-mom kim bop rolls I've had in my life.

We asked for ama-ebi (sweet shrimp), which was soft, tender, and sweet, with perfectly fried shrimp head to back.  This was the first time I've had such perfectly made ama-ebi, and it's made me want to continue my search in Chicago.

Some tasty mochi desserts, a few bottle of sake, and all in all, it was a very enjoyable night for my compadres and I.  

I'm sorry for those that have found a bad experience at Otaku, as it sounds like most of it is waitstaff issues... but as a sushi fanatic, my advice to you is this:

1.  Don't ask for a table if you're party is smaller than 4... ask for a spot at the sushi counter, because that's how sushi is meant to be served.  Getting to know your chef, the chef getting to know you, having drinks together, etc.  

2.  Ask the chef what he/she recommends.  Not all fish are equally fresh, and the chef will know what's best for the day.  And if you can provide them with your own past experience of what you liked/didn't like, they'll likely craft a sushi experience for you that you'll love.

Verdict:  If only Otaku were in Chicago... I might go broke.  Delicious sushi, and worth a visit!",3,4,0,9.5,"Positive","5"
"2465","OGliW0Iolmdz8B-uJrDbDw","4","I cannot speak for the food, (though the menu looked unique and tantalizing), but the beer selection was great, as was service. We arrived on Saturday night, the first weekend Angels Trumpet was open, around 10 p.m. for drinks. There was a large group of us, 9 people... though there weren't any tables to accomodate our party we were able to stand/be seated comfortably around one of the high-tops.

This place is great for smaller parties who enjoy a good beer. The selection cannot be beat in downtown Phoenix -- 31 craft brews on tap of every taste and style... and they're always rotating. I had the Biere Blonde & White... 4.5% alcohol, light, sunny taste. Reminded me of Four Peak's SunBrew.

The selection ranges from hoppy IPAs at 10% alcohol/volume to the lighter, summer brews and everything in between. There is literally something for everyone, even a few wines on tap for the non-beer drinkers.

Our server was very nice and accommodating.. and though the place was packed she got us our drinks pretty quickly.

A couple reasons I didn't give Angels Trumpet the perfect '5' star rating:

Disorganization-- Seating was sort of a nightmare... and we kind of waited around for one of the high-tops to open up and just snagged it.
Ambience-- I enjoyed the nice, open floor plan but the restaurant-style and dozens of tables/chairs was a bit puzzling considering the kitchen was closed when we arrived. I couldn't hear any music above the conversations in the room and the huge, 60"" TV screens weren't turned on. It'd be nice for weekend nights to boast something a little more special. If you're going to close the kitchen, allow people to walk around and mingle more.

Overall, if you're looking for a nice place to kick back with a small group of friends and try some awesome, unique beers on tap, Angels Trumpet is it. Their prices are reasonable for the quality offered. Haven't tried the food, but the menu is pretty diverse offering a spin on traditional bar food like flatbread pizzas and sandwiches.",0,0,0,9,"Positive","5"

The empanadas were baked just to golden brown and the crust was so flaky and delicious words cannot describe it.  I had lemon and cherry, but I wanted to try one of everything.  The red chili in the burritos was mild but very flavorful.  Luckily they are wrapped in foil because I couldn't wait to get home to devour mine.

"2488","CQEOzdAPHNEbnxdgUzT32w","3","I am a bonafide book junkie. Libraries are my mecca. But, I'm picky. 

Getting a SPL card was a cinch. I only needed one proof of residence, although I brought the recommended three, including a Netflix envelope. 

Once I had my card, I was ready to explore. I headed first to the public computers that help you locate books... yes! With scraps of papers and mini-pencils handy, I was good to go, once I had selected a couple books to hunt down. 

So far, so good.

But then the library got tricky. Running out of the alphabet before I had found my book. Turning into another section - from Fiction to Large Print. WTF? I decided to turn this hunt into more of a tour, so I wandered the aisles, studied the names of sections and eventually re-acquainted myself with the library system. 

Don't get me wrong. This isn't rocket science. It's also not pop rocks. 

Having found my books and a couple DVDs, I proceeded to check out. Super easy, too. I can renew online? Bonus!

My first trip to the library was GREAT. 

Then the second one came. The library had NONE of the books I came looking for, and I was prepared to find AT LEAST ONE of the books on my list of 5. Nope. So I put some ""on hold"" for me and wandered about, very disappointed. That's when I began to dislike this library. None of my books? Really? 

This library isn't browsing-friendly like others I have seen. Even the ol' library in Stillwater, Oklahoma was more comfortable than this one. In fact, I miss that ol' library, with its shelves of poetry, psychology, magazines and literature... so easy to find, so easy to browse, so easy to sit for hours and read. 

I couldn't leave SPL fast enough. On my way out, a man working (volunteering?) there showed me how to use the self-service check-out system. Nice! He was a friendly ol' man, who assumed I knew NOTHING about self-service machines... and probably doubted my ability to read, for he explained step-by-step what I needed to do in order to check out my books. At least the lesson was in-depth enough for me to fully comprehend - and then some. 

So, the next time I went to SPL - to pick up the books I had put on hold (score!) - I used the self-service check-out. I was in and out in like 7.46 minutes. 

So, let's recap:
*SLP has books!
*SLP doesn't always have the books you want. (Sad face)
*You can renew online, create a profile and share reviews. 
*You can place books on-hold from any computer, if you're logged into your account.
*People working there are friendly.
*It's easy to get a card. Just bring in your SRP bill, like I did. 
*It's not an easy place to browse.
*SPL doesn't make you feel like you want to spend hours there.
*There are private rooms; just not sure how you reserve them.
*There are monthly activities at the library - but mostly about old-fart diets and how to use Microsoft Word. 
*There's FREE parking in THE SHADE! 
*You can check your items out yourself, with their self-service check-out machine. 
*It's pretty ugly inside - brown, biege, dull and lifeless.",1,1,2,6.5,"Positive","4"

So the day we decide to go, the guy from the Colbert report was there mocking the restaurant also.  We go in and we thought, ""hey wow, this is kinda cool"" as they talked about monster proportions of burgers and fries fried in lard.  However, once the food arrived we sat down and although the wait staff was scantily clad, all of them had ""cottage cheese"" legs and thighs.  We sat down, and my friend decides to take their super burger challenge, she said if he finished his 2 lbs burger, his meal would be on the house.  He kills it, and when we ask why his burger wasn't free, we could no longer find out waitress and the owner says to us ""you either pay or i come over the counter"" he threatened us with violence, which is stupid as all we were doing was asking what about what the waitress had told us.  We will never ever go there again.  Being Asian, he also spewed racial slurs at us, calling us to go back to where we came from.  ALL of us were born and raised in Arizona so I don't know where we would go.  Anyways, don't go here.  

Also, all of the patrons, ALL of them were middle aged men, who instead of paying attention to their wives and kids were hiding away at a nasty restaurant who's burgers aren't even really grilled.  the frozen patties from costco are placed on a machine that rolls the burgers through, so you can't even want a medium burger, they are all torched.  The fries although fried in lard, are crap.  All in all, if you're a lonely loser, this is the place for you.

The instructors are great!  They always take the time to say hello outside of class and they are very caring.  

The class ratio is fantastic - with a max of 3:1 in each beginner (Starfish) class.  

Currently the price is $72/month, which includes 1 class per week during the Spring and Summer and the ability to schedule unlimited classes per week from October-February.  The school also routinely sends emails for a free class when there is same day availability (usually with newer instructors).

I think there is something lost in translation from its Texas roots to AZ.  Gone is the appeal of the gas station dive.  Atmosphere feels a little phony in a pretty, new building.  The biggest problems I have with the food is the overpowering mesquite flavor and mediocre sauces.  The Texas roots explains the loyalty to mesquite, which is understandable and you cant fault them for staying true... but a little hickory or less creosote-tasting smoke would be nice for a non-Texas palette.  The sauces seem a little amateur.  I know Rudy's is no amateur in the business, but I think they settled too soon on their signature sauces - they taste like the first ones I made in my backyard.

I try to avoid WM.  I'm always warned about the possibility of TB or now, pig flu.  I think the hub just doesn't want to go shopping--not that I LIKE shopping.

I know someone who worked WM in WA and she says the conditions are just horrible for employees.  I've spoken to at least one cashier that is actually FRIENDLY and LOVES his job benefits and bonuses.  He's a minority I guess bc as you all said, YOU CAN'T FIND ANYTHING and CAN'T GET HELP without attitude, usually.  

I'm standing there staring at 2 mgrs, and they just ignore me for a few minutes?  I didn't want to interrupt the conversation, so I waited.  FINALLY, one asks if I need help???  NAAAAAH, I was just admiring your huge body and wondered how long it might take me to look that way.  FOOLS!  

On my last visit, a customer said ""excuse me"" to the 3 employees behind me in the aisle.  I glanced at her and she sighed, rolled her eyes and shook her head as they all ignored her.  I chuckled and acknowledged her frustration.  Then one employee pipes up with ""OH, I'm sorry ma'am, can we help you?""  She asks to find an item, the customer thanks them, they say ""You're welcome"", the customer leaves and they sarcastically continue to each other: ""THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HERE FOR.  NO, THAT'S NOT WHY WE'RE HERE.  We're not here to find stuff for stupid people, we have better things to do.""    That's why, when I walk by an employee working, if they lay eyes on me, they immediately look away and pretend to be engrossed in their job, to avoid stopping to help.  WT?  What's wrong w/this management???  

I agree, you can find some deals and save some money, but the attitude is over the top.  There are a FEW employees that actually smile and appear friendly, at least when I see them, and I can point them out.  If not for the more often than not occurences as mentioned above, I stay OUT of WM as much as possible, which is a lot.

We decided to come here because we had never been to this one.  We arrived and were seated right away.  Surprisingly this one wasn't crowded at all and that was fine by us.  

We got a small caesar salad, a small pepperoni and garlic, and a personal white pizza with roasted red peppers.  A few minutes later we got our salad.  It was really good.

Anyways, spent time in the bar which was nice, the bartenders were willing to answer questions, though not always the most chatty, but I think that was due more to how busy it was then not being friendly. The happy hour prices looked pretty good, $2 hot sake, $3 beer, $4-5 cocktails. Sushi was also on the cheap, Nigiri was from about 1.25-2 dollars I believe, and the other rolls ran from 3-5 dollars at the worst. They also have some non-sushi appetizers on there. 

Once we got a table, we were paired with another group, which was actually a nice experience as I do like the communal type seating stuff. Granted if you have a small group and not a fan of eating with strangers, might not like it much. 

Since it is a place I always consider more about a show then the food, going to start with that first. The show was eh, they do some of the knife play stuff, and a few things here and there, but honestly it wasn't all that exciting compared to the other place I've been (Sakura). The chef was friendly though, and the server was personable so that is a plus. Otherwise was a bit disappointed with the show portion of the meal. 

As for the food, I had the Filet Mignon and lobster tail. The filet was supposed to be medium, but came out more medium well in my opinion. It was lightly seasoned, leaving mostly a beef flavor then anything else. Now it had a good beef flavor, so by no means complaining just like a bit more seasoning personally. The lobster tail was good, buttery from the butter, but more importantly nice and sweet. How it is to other lobster tails? can't really tell you as I don't eat it that much (college students don't exactly have that sort of cash you know? =P). But again thought it was good, wasn't fishy and nice and sweet. 

At the end it came with a choice of ice cream, I tried the green tea ice cream which about the same as any other green tea ice cream I've had. Basically its sweet, with a hint of green tea taste, and that is about it. 

They have to sing to you of course, and they take a picture which they give you with a code you can access for up to 60 days (I believe) to download it, which is a nice touch.

This restaurant has been here for 38 years.  I've been going here off and on for 35 years.  I go here more for sentimental reasons, and not so much for the food.  

The interior still retains some of the original decoration style from the original restaurant established nearly 40 years ago.  The rest of the decorations have been torn out.  I believe the decor is modeled after the Forbidden Palace in Beijing - see the vault-of-the-heavens style crenelations in the ceiling.  

I have this restaurant - in its former self - to thank for this:  Back in its day, this restaurant was really great, and the entire atmosphere lent to an ambiance that actually inspired me to study Chinese and then later go live over there for some years. 

Sadly, the food here is not all that good.  The fryer oil they use here is pretty old.  The fried rice arrives looking almost black (from the fryer oil?  too much soy sauce?) instead of a rich golden brown, and tastes overcooked somehow.  The eggrolls are just OK.  Definitely not fresh.

A lot of the menu items from the original owners are no longer on the menu; for example the special ""Chinese cakes"" served on a plate topped with a delicious gravy-like brown sauce and shallots - probably some form of Cantonese food.  All of this is gone, and replaced by very plain fare, and not very good at that.  

If you like salty, greasy, plain-tasting yet somehow edible Chinese food not far from the $1-per-scoop variety, then go here.  Golden Phoenix's heyday as a great restaurant is long-gone.

He asked for a new one, and she comes back and say's Eddie cooked the hamburger and refused to cook a new one but would make him a new bun. He didn't want that because he hates Mayo that much, so there was no problem taking it off the tab, but Eddie would not make a new one. LOL. What's up Eddie???

Ruling: It's OK and a worthy stop in Scottsdale for a pre-dinner beverage. 

Sure, I could front load my review with spicy adjectives, overinflated superlatives, some forced humor, and throw on an added star and hope for a ROTD (come on, don't pretend that you don't know the formula), but I am not selling my stars for a day on the big screen. 

If it's been said once, twice, and even thrice, need I repeat it? Yes, because it is true -- this is not Postino, and for that matter, this is not Kaz. It is a good, local spot to grab a glass of wine, maybe even with your mom, who may not be hip enough to chill at Postino on Central (which really requires little hipness, I mean they let me in), or your dad, who may not be able to read in the dark at Kaz, or maybe for that friend from Gilbert, who you know, wants to walk the wide straight path of predictability. 

Predictability isn't bad...in this case, that means a good wine selection (could rotate more), full bar, usually one good draft or two out of 5, decent cocktails, and decent food. The food is not really what you come for. The bruschetta is sub par, but the salads are above par. And, I have to add, hummus with no flat bread or pita?? No. No pita for you! 

Service runs from friendly (read, management) to disillusioned and inattentive. The latter tends to happen if you sit outside. The last time I was in, I think grapes were crushed, olives were pressed, and chickpeas were ground...at least they could have been. 

Often they have live music too, which runs from the somewhat awkward jazz guy who keeps talking to you to the Motown wedding singer -- which on at least one occasion brought out near Elaine Benes-style dancing -- now that was worth the visit and waiting for the grape crushing.",2,3,2,1,"Positive","4"

The Asian tapas idea is new to me, having dined at some great Tapas places from Chicago to Vegas,  but alas never an Asian tapas joint. I must say no Spanish tapas place ever made me feel like Sens did (except the time I drank a pitcher of Sangria)!

The Tofu dishes are amazing. How do you learn to love Okra? Get it at Sens. The Hong Kong rice noodles were not what I was expecting so I was a little taken back by them looking like a plateful of water chestnuts. One taste was all that was needed to cure my trepidations about the flavor - fantastic!

I had purchased an online deal because I've always wanted to do something like this and thought it to be a great gift for my other half. I sent her a message and she quickly responded. Almost everything I needed to know for the shoot was emailed to me. You have the opportunity to do your own hair and makeup or have someone she works with do it at a reasonable rate. I highly recommend that you get it done by her ladies. That day I saw Erica. She was really fun and got me into the mood (the glass of wine helped too :-) ) and she did an incredible job with the makeup and hair. For those who feel a little nervous I do recommend bringing some wine along with you. It really loosens you up a bit and allows you to be more comfortable. It was perfect since my first photos were the nude shots. Note: wear loose fitting clothing, nothing elastic and be sure that you do not have a sunburn on your body. Let your hair air dry and it is OK to put on your own serums and moisturizers prior to the shoot. Make sure nothing with sunscreen gets on your face and while it's not necessary, I made sure to use a primer. I thought it really helped out with how my makeup set. Be prepared to pose in positions that may be a bit awkward and also note that you will likely be sore the next day from the different twisting that you have to do. Jodi really knows how to make you feel comfortable and at ease. I don't make a habit of being in the buff in front of complete strangers and for me to drop my robe without feeling shy was a big deal for me. It helped that I had my own music mix on my iPod throughout the entire shoot as well. The overall whole experience was incredible. I felt sexy and confident. I went back with my honey to look at the photos. He really really liked them and had a hard time choosing which he wanted to go into the album. I can't wait to see everything finished. I can't wait to do it again :) Thank you Jodi for making it such a memorable experience. I highly recommend her and her ladies!!!",0,1,0,9.5,"Positive","4"

I did not expect ceviche in AZ to be so fresh and delicious! And not only that, but they also served it with proper cancha and Inca Kola is a beverage option (which of course I had to order). 
Unfortunately, I have to give my experience 4 stars instead of 5 because they were out of Aji de Gallina, which is what my brother had his heart set on for dinner that night.

"2739","Jubdf4YjHmVvi2GSmR_iIQ","3","It's unfair to review this mall on what it was - since it no longer is (and what it is isn't as good as what it was). It's also unfair to review this on what it will be - since it isn't that yet. 

Today, it's a mall I rarely visit. Apart from a few stores I would visit out of convenience or necessity, there's not much to offer compared to what it used to have. The fantastic movie theater, Jutenhoops, Alpine Ski Keller, Bear Cover, and even Ed Debevics are all long gone... oops, there I go bringing up the past. Seriously though, these were painful to lose - one by one.

So today, there's a Linens 'n' Things which is hardly unique, and a Trader Joe's which is nice to have in the area, and also a Sister's Attic and Closet upscale thrift stores which add a bit of much-needed flavor. The Chili's, the Bookstar, and Black Angus are still around. So is the jewelry store that has never really offered a compelling reason to enter. They've wedged an LA Fitness here and they've also added a Blimpie and an Arby's... all very healthy choices. 

Besides all of the generic shops and eateries and standard offerings, there's still a few unique experiences - though nothing like it used to... shit, there I go again. Anyway, so there's a few places that aren't screaming ""standard mall"" such as Pita Grill, a pipe and tobacco shoppe (you have to spell it that way in this case), a place to get eyewear, and some other small and uninteresting businesses. 

In that sense, I suppose this is has become a decent and convenient neighborhood strip mall. This is a shame really since it's lacking most of the key elements that made it really special. It's still a beautiful outdoor mall and the architecture alone makes it a unique alternative to the cookie-cutter malls that strategically litter the landscape of America. 

I'm worried about what they'll do to the architecture when they renovate this place someday, but I think the fact that this mall isn't terribly interesting anymore in general means it won't be so terribly missed when they lose that last remaining bit of ""special.""",3,3,2,1,"Positive","4"

I have now been three times (can you blame a gal for craving a burger?) and each time everyone is almost too overfriendly. They ask if you have been in before and if you state no, they offer to go over the menu. Now this might stop after this location has been open longer, but it's helpful since there are only a few locations in the valley. When your order is ready, you are paged and you go up to grab your meal, and they always find it necessary to read back your order, when right in your hand is a tray with a juicy burger begging you to take a bite... so I am always a little feisty for them to read it off, since I want to chow down! They also seem to want to check in on you while you are eating, which is nice... but can be overwhelming if you are on your lunch break and trying to catch up with a friend... but I won't complain about good ol' polite customer service.

I temped him with the offer of a chocolate shake.

I was amazed with the cleanliness and brightness of this place.  There was a line when we got there, but it moved quickly.  The tables were packed but we managed to snag a 2-top pretty soon after getting in line.  My son had the kids grilled cheese meal (something you don't find at your standard fast food place) and I had a charburger.  We shared his fries and the shake.

OMG - the burger was heavenly!  The roll gets a little grill to it so it has a little crunch on the inside.  It was not greasy at all, just tasty and soooo good!  The fries were equally ungreasy and good - crunchy too.  The chocolate shake - my son only had about 3 sips which left me to drink the rest of it (dang it) - was absolutely delish.

Went in for lunch today and I was the only customer, so I figured cool I will get good service no matter what. The girl sat me and was very pleasant and indicated my waitress would be right over. About ten minutes later, watching the waitress talk on a personal phone call at the bar the whole time, the girl who sat me came over to take the order. She walked up, didn't say a word, and just stared at me. Ok I can live with that it was only a minor inconviencence. 

Got the #4 lunch chopped pork sandwich with beans and a lemonade and it came out very quickly. Possibly because the beans were Bush's or the like? They tasted like canned baked beans heated up in a microwave. Not cool. The sandwich was ok at best. Thinking back on Stacy's, Honey Bear's, and other great BBQ spots, this one was not even in the same arena. I'll have to go back though and try a sandwich with the correct sauce on it. There was one sauce on the table which after reading reviews here I had assumed was the BBQ sauce. It looked a little watery but I thought whatever its NC style, and it may have been because it was a bit vinegary. On the way out I noticed every other table had a red sauce labeled BBQ, so I guess they have two different ones. I would have preferred the red one I assume. 

There was no atmosphere, the place was run down (doesn't appear to have been remodeled after Shish Kabob House vacated) and was generally a dirty feeling place.

I figured it couldn't hurt for as cheep as I got the room through Priceline. I cant say enough about how well we were treated at this resort.

The bathroom was very clean as was the entire room. The ground around the entire resort were impeccable. There are either 4 or 5 pools through out the resort and the main pool has a small waterfall. The jacuzzi tubs were all very warm and in working order. We didn't order room service but I did browse through the menu and the prices were really reasonable. Everyone we met that worked at the resort was extremely friendly with the exception of one bartender at the poolside cabana bar. Overall I would have rated the entire experience with 5 stars the reason I gave it only 4 stars is because of our experience at the poolside cabana. On Saturday afternoon we walked down to the poolside bar area to have a drink and we sat at a table near the bar. We were ignored by the bartender for over 15 minutes while he talked to some young girl in a bikini who was already done getting her drinks. When we were finally acknowledged we asked him if he knew how to make a certain drink he quickly replied no what else do you want in a very rude manner. We each ordered some Orange drink that was on special and it was terrible. So I am taking a half star for that experience and a half star for the extremely high price of wi-fi. It would have cost nearly $13.00 a day so we decided to pass. Thank God for our smart phones. Overall we really loved our weekend at this resort and would definitely return  especially for the great price we got through Priceline although I never did get a chance to see a regular room and I wonder if our experience would have been as good if we hadn't upgraded to the suite.",0,1,0,10,"Positive","4"

The taste of the leeks coupled with the cheese, buttery and flaky pastry made this one of the most tasty ways to start a meal. I ordered the marinated chicken. This dish came with a juicy chicken breast with a light pesto sauce, mashed potatoes and sauteed spinach. The flavors intermingled to create a sensuous bite, time and time again. My girlfriend got the filet, which was juicy and flavorful and came with perfectly roasted potatoes and tomatoes. For dessert we ordered the tart of the day, which was fruit and coconut cream on top of a shortbread-tasting tart. Just delicious. The service was wonderful, very efficient and friendly.

From the very first slice, the longhorn cheddar-topped patty crumbled into many pieces- I kept wishing I had a spoon to scoop them up!  No matter, as it was still a wonderful meal- loved the smoked bacon, and the chipotle mayo worked well both as a burger condiment and as a dip for the wonderfully crisp and seasoned fries (see photos).

As for the staff?  Well our first waitress was a little too friendly and just about sat in my husbands lap....oh, I know that a little flirting comes with the job and is what you do to get a better tip, but come on honey, how did you know that I was not paying for that dinner?  If I was, the only tip you would of gotten would of been a 'back off a little on the whole, I have daddy issues in flirting'!  I have to admit though, once we changed seats after our dinner and went into the lounge area of the Bungalow, our waitress knew exactly what she was doing when it came to her job and her flirting was exceptional.....she knew how to work it while still being a classy lady, and I respect that! 
As for the clientele of this place, it's a younger crowd full of loud drunk guys at the bar watching the football game.  What you expect in a sports bar.....Outside the crowds quieter and more tolerable.

We went today, a Sunday, and sat down next to people that had the exact same dog that we have (a female harlequin Great Dane) and knew that it was fate.  We sat by them, because they seemed awesome and in great company, the food flourished in my eyes.  

They have a pretty decent beer selection, they had my favorite Sonoran White Chocolate ale and my boyfriend had something he loved on tap called the Bell's Two Hearted Ale (but apparently it's an amazing IPA). I knew I'd love mine, he LOVED his.

We had the Mac and Cheese, which was awesome, but not as amazing as others I've had.  So order it if your a Mac person, but don't if you're not.  

We had two sandwiches for dinner, I had the Acapulco Cheesesteak (UNBELIEVABLE!!!!!!!!!!!)  and Seann had the RB&C (an equally impressive Roast Beef concoction). Those were both devoured with great beer and great conversation with others.

Lastly we had the Triple Chocolate Brownie, per a recommendation from our fellow dog owner and it was delish.  VERY VERY chocolatey and too much food after an app, a sandwich and two beers, but it was definitely worth trying.

The bar area is relatively small, but very classy.  We were able to have few drinks at the bar ($5 for beer, wine, and their signature cocktails) before we were able to get a table in the bar area for 5 people...thanks to Leah and the hostess staff (you guys are great).  Didn't have a bad drink -- loved the The Original Hawaiian martini was delish, as was the mojito, jalapeno margarita, mai tai, and wine.  A friend was sad the cucumber drink she liked was missing from the menu, but sounds like the menu changes often so diners/drinkers get a chance to try new concoctions throughout the year.  

For food, we tried most of the HH specials.  Everything was spot on -- excellent flavors and beautifully presented.  The tuna roll and tempura shrimp rolls were my favorites (sushi rolls), with the lobster pot-stickers being a close second.  Some friends ordered dinner...and were able to speak with Chef Bray about his recommendations for fish.  She ended up getting the Crab Dynamite Baked Barramundi, which was so yummy!  The happy rice on the side was great too.   My hubby got the Yellow Fin Ahi Poke -- something we have looked for since trying some fresh poke in Kona, HI last year.  I couldn't believe the flavors...eating poke in the AZ desert!  Its preparation with the Wasabi Crème Fraîche made it a meal we will seek out again in the near future.

Everything has tasted decent and I'm not really sure what qualifies as having ""Fine Burgers"" in a restaurant title, but I don't think Islands has it. The restaurant itself is very clean and the bathrooms are well kept. The only downside is the acoustics in this place. It can get very loud when its busy and almost annoyingly loud when there are a few kids in the joint.",0,2,0,2.5,"Positive","4"
"2919","tRE_MmGyDQBCp6GsX7xUkQ","4","I think for my sesquicentennial review, I've gotten to a point where I'm letting the food direct the show of stars. Sure, we have the servers and cooks as producers, the location as our stage, lighting, sound and supporting staff. But the meal, ah, that is our celebrated lead actor. Without it, all other pieces may paint a pretty picture, but what good is a painting when it medium is missing? 

The Mission really delivers its lines well. Almost too well. Like Dakota Fanning well. Each plate has a spectrum of flavors--bold and smoky with subtle and delicate undertones of fresh herbs. Each dish is skillfully plated and ready for its closeup. My steak tacos were so intensely flavored, I didn't really dwell on the fact there were but three petite tortilla shells mounded with strips of magnificently grilled flank steak and slices of fresh avocado. And the papas y chorizo, which I ordered as an accompaniment, helped balance the palate yet was still a strong item on its own. Robert M's pozole was as unique as it was flavorful, delicious, satisfying and, ironically, humble. The bread pudding he ordered at the end of meal was, according to him, a premature ejaculation. Apparently, that means it was good, so I'll take his word for that. Those who joined us for this meal seemed to share some of the enthusiasm over the dessert, but I don't eat sweets so will have to believe their accolades worthy. 

What, pray tell, denies The Mission of the much clamored five-star rating? Primarily, it's the associated fees. On one hand, I was blown away by the sensuous flavors apparent in every edible item. On the other hand, I was blown away upon seeing the bill (especially since I had nothing but water to drink). Does one negate the other? Perhaps. Am I at a place in my life where such a statement rings true? Not necessarily. While my initial response was, I wouldn't likely return to The Mission if it was my decision, I confess that I would, willingly, give myself back to The Mission if only for the sublime sins of doting on sustenance.",7,8,8,11,"Positive","4"

There are two types of chinese food. Cheap, greasy, satisfying chinese food in a questionable joint. And upscale atmospheric chinese food that aspires to captivate the same audiences that enjoy places like P.F Chengs. This would be the latter: an awhatukee hole in the wall version of P.F chengs. Very clean restaurant, nice atmosphere, and good service. You can tell their motif is such that they cater to the tukee types with a little more coin in hand :/. This is the kind of place you'll find a lot of older families, or much older groups of friends dining together in. 

Both the orange chicken, and the almond chicken were good, and were made barring on the side of caution when it comes to grease. They were big portions (for $8), with big fresh peices of white meat, fresh vegetables, and no MSG. There is no chance of this meal offending a pickier type with grease, textures, or flavors (which makes it less interesting in my opinion).

Both dishes were good, but nothing amazing from the 2 dishes I tried. 

The green tea ice cream was good, but I've had better green tea ice cream :/ . their version was a little too heavy with cream, and could have used some fruit, or something creative to go with the ice cream.

The ones from Tacos Atoyas was only a okay compare to the ones in LA.   Usually the tacos I have are overflow with meat, but these are only half way filled.  Taste was a okay too.

Unfortunately, they had sold out of the oysters, but the other dishes we'd ordered were fabulous - starting with a seared tuna dish, then softshell crab roll, rainbow roll, and the green mussels. The seared tuna was cooked and cut perfectly - just the right temperature with a peppery ""rub,"" the rolls were a decent size with thick cuts of fish and plenty of flavorful crab, and the mussels were a tad overcooked for my preference but the creamy texture and buttery flavor still made it a winner. 

The thing I appreciated most was actually the service - we weren't rushed or hassled, and the food came out a dish at a time, giving us a chance to eat and enjoy before getting our next dish. At other sushi joints, I am constantly feeling rushed while trying to fit all of the dishes on the table (and I'm not what you'd call a slow eater!). This was a happy medium for me. The server confirmed that we were ready for the bill instead of just dropping it off without asking - it's the little details that make a big difference to me.

"2964","FrUT9VYLb7WvaVdCwT86ew","5","As a frequent traveler into Scottsdale, I was looking for something new and different to celebrate with a young up and coming professional baseball player---who happens to be my nephew. We were forewarned this place had no prices on their online menu and appeared to be owned by Mastro's which consistently has excellent food. 

Michael Dominick opened Dominick's Lincoln Avenue Prime Steakhouse last fall after baseball season in the small, but excellent Scottsdale Quarter. (I'll admit to frequenting this Nike store in travels to Phoenix.) The ambiance is that of an elegant steakhouse. The rooms are dark with huge crystal chandeliers. Very opulent without being ostentatious!. 

We both ordered the bone-in filet which is an excellent aged prime cut. Supposedly, according to our very professional server, this cut is about 16 oz with a bone yielding about a 14 oz serving. My limit on steak is typical 6-8 ounces and I ate my entire meal, making me think (1) This place really is THAT GOOD, and (2) I doubt this is more than a 10 oz serving. 

We started with a warm assortment of breads and in deference to my guest, we minimized the veggie's ordered. (I'll go back during baseball season :-) ) 

After ordering a glass of of the extensive, but reasonably priced wine list, we looked at dinner entree. The steaks come with a choice of rubs and sauces. The house rub was described as ""cajun-style, but not overwhelming"". My theory is sauces on steaks are useful for poor cuts of meat, but take away from great cuts; hence, I went no sauce. 

The result was an incredibly great dinner of Bone-in filets ordered medium rare, no sauce and a loaded mashed potato side. (This side comes pre-prepared or you can ask for ramikans of cheese, chives, bacon and sour cream and build as you like at the table. We finished with a scoop of ice cream and a cappuccino for desert. 

Excellent steak spot and a welcome high-end addition to the Scottsdale food scene.

One comment: The ""Branding"" of the restaurant is confusing. Either call it ""Dominick's"" or ""Lincoln Avenue"", but not both. This actually caused confusion in trying to locate this spot and diminishes the feng shui and brand loyalty you'd want to keep and associate.

Of the apps, we had toasted ravioli, a platter of antipasti, and by recommendation from our lovely server, Amber, the stuffed eggplant.  The toasted ravioli was delicious-crispy and battered with a crust of parmigiana, melty cheese on the inside. A dip in the flavorful and slightly spicy marinara sauce finished it off.  

The antipasti platter serves about 2 light eaters, but for me and my spouse, it was a nice compliment to the two other shared appetizers. 

The stuffed eggplant was covered inside and out with gooey, cheesy goodness and marinara sauce.  This was to be the main portion of my meal while my husband had gorged on the appetizers, but after a taste, he started sneaking bites while I wasn't looking!  I added some chili flakes for a little heat, but It was very flavorful.  I'm not a huge melted cheese lover and would've preferred a little less cheese, but it was perfect for my husband.

I ordered the grilled cheese which was okay, really not tasty as it should be. 
My friend and I shared the rock shrimp which was awful, tasteless and the shrimp was not cleaned through so we had some crunchy sand like experience. Then we shared the corn flat bread which looked and tasted like airport food. 
We decided to leave and got our check - for what we got paying that much was a big disappointment. They didn't even take the kid pasta dish off... $5 people... really?

Things I've tried there:

LoLo's special which is 3 piece of chicken with 2 waffles, Stupid fries, side of potatoes smothered, Chyna's honey hots (which are their hotwings), Ivan's chorizo and eggs, and their banana cream pudding.

Their chicken is perfectly cooked.  Nice, crunchy, juicy, and very flavorful.  Their waffles are fantastic as well, but my all time favorite has got to be their Stupid Fries.  It's a basket of freshly cooked french fries smothered in gravy with bits of bell peppers, onions, and chunks of their fried chicken.  I have no idea how they do it but even though their fries are smothered, it stays extra crispy under all that sauce.  That's what makes it so darn delicious.  It's definitely a meal in itself.  Their banana cream pudding is so large you guys can share it.  Banana cream anything is one of my favorites so of course I would say that it was amazing!!

Their koolaide are awesome as well.  You can't come here and not have their koolaide.  I love their blue but I sometime switch it up to red.

D. Black-outs
D+. I have a scar on my left knee where I ate shit playing cornhole. How do you eat shit playing cornhole? No clue. Probably because of the above point listed above. 
E. Lodge stimulus package - $6 for a can of PBR, a shot of nasty ass whisky, and a cigarette. BEST DEAL IN TOWN. Pretty sure the ex got nice and hammered a few times off this lil package - great deal ladies. Get your man sloshed and then take advantage of him. Always a good idea.

Secondly, convenient economy parking is a must. Convenient economy parking at Sky Harbor... Check. Not to mention the shuttle drivers are always friendly and small talk-ready.

The TSA folks here also seem to smile and playfully banter with travelers more readily than at other airports. Perhaps this is due in part to Sky Harbor's ""America's Friendliest Airport"" marketing ploy, but in any case it's certainly something to remark about.

I doubt Phoenix will turn into any sort of true travel hub in the near future, but more non-stop international flights would certainly be welcomed. But until the demand is clearly defined we'll have to be content with a few flights to Europe, Canada, Mexico, and the lone wolf to Costa Rica.

I am very excited to see the Sky Train completed and operational with Stage One scheduled to be up and running in 2013. This will allow connections from the light rail and offer a new mode of transportation from the east economy lot to terminal 4.

I've seen previous reviews complaining about having to go back through security when changing terminals, which is actually the case in many airports throughout the world. The terminal is the secure area so whenever you leave it you naturally have to be screened again. There are a few exceptions, but the easiest way to circumvent this is to fly the same airline from point A all the way to point B. If you're connecting at Sky Harbor you should only be flying US Airways/United or Southwest so as to avoid a terminal change. If you're not flying these carriers then you're over-complicating things for yourself and you should look for different routing.

The central location of Sky Harbor makes it extremely accessible for people living in most parts of the valley, which is a huge plus considering the location of other airports outside of their corresponding metropolitan areas. All in all, there's really nothing significant to complain about Sky Harbor.

P.S. The Fox Sports Grill at Sky Harbor is a true embarrassment, not that one should expect a great deal from airport restaurants, but if Kraft Mac-N-Cheese (this is probably a poor example as KMNC provides a perfect vehicle for some truly delicious creations) is far superior to what you're serving, then you should just end it all.

No matter whether I've been to Fogo in DC, Baltimore or here in Scottsdale, I get the same gut-busting food and well-made drinks in a place where I could either wear a suit and tie or jeans and a t-shirt.

A specific note on this particular location- there were a lot of families with small children on this particular Friday night. No judging, but I've never seen that at any other Fogo. Fogo back east is really ""date night"" or the kind of place to pre-game for a bachelor party or a business dinner, but not to bring infants and toddlers. Possibly a by-product of its location on Scottsdale Road in a strip mall near a few hotels. IMHO, this is not the place to bring kids, but I respect the rights of anyone to do so.

Bar Smith though? They failed on so many levels. 

I got there sometime between 10:30 and 11:00 and there was about a 20 minute wait out front. Not the end of the world or anything but after finally getting in, there was a sea of bodies and another very long wait. About 50 people were lined up by the stair case waiting to get upstairs. There was a bouncer not allowing anyone up there until people would slowly trickle out. Why they put Z-Trip on the patio, I don't know. It's the size of a shoe box and was clearly to capacity before 11 PM. FAIL FAIL FAIL FAIL FAIL!! 

I was in various lines roughly 50 minutes and still hadn't made it upstairs. Forget about stepping out of line to get a drink because you'd lose your place. The short of it is I paid for pre sale tickets, managed to get there at a decent time, and still had to wait close to an hour just to get in the same room as the guy. It was a total let down. 

At that point I was so ready to just walk out and ask for my money back. They clearly oversold the event and didn't give much thought about their patrons who paid money to see this DJ. They were going to fit every last body into that place if it killed them...and everyone else in there. 

After finally getting upstairs there were so many bodies, no one could move at all. It was a total clusterfuck. I finally made it to the back bar and stood in line for 10 minutes just to find out their card reader broke earlier in the night. Fantastic. No signs saying it was a cash bar, that would have been a nice gesture. 

Also, the bathrooms were downstairs, so forget about having to pee AT ALL during the 2+ hours you're there. If you had to go, you better hold it, otherwise you'd be waiting in line for another 30 minutes just to get back up. 

By the time Z-Trip came on, the sound was bass heavy and mildly distorted. I inched my way to various parts of the patio but the sound didn't get any better, so my partner and I said fuck it and went downstairs for the rest of the night. Thankfully they were playing his set downstairs and upstairs. At least people could move more easily downstairs. Plus the sound was better. And the bathrooms were actually accessible.

1.  I am tired of people complaining about the prices at Sapporo.    When you compare price vs. quality you will always be in a favorable position.  If you cannot afford Sapporo perhaps you shouldn't eat there. I am not trying to sound arrogant, but you truly get what you pay for.   Sapporo consistently prepares the best  sushi I have had in Arizona.

2.  I understand wait time may be an issue.  I suggest that you arrive early and anticipate a wait.  Honestly, is thirty minutes on a Friday night going to bother you?  The food is well worth the wait.  

3.  Please stop wearing flip-flops and bathing suits.  Perhaps this is the reason you are experiencing ""rude"" service.  A pair of jeans and a polo is fine.

The food is great if not fancy, and the place is pretty free of gimmicks.  You can get your fix of cheese crisps (aka quesadillas for you CA transplants), deep fried tacos, chimichangas, combination plates with so much sauce and cheese you can't tell what's underneath but it all works together to taste so good.  Los Olivos still plops down the free chips and salsa right when you sit down so you're good an full when that combo plate comes and glad for it.  The atmosphere is more like a nice mexican diner than mexican cantina and service is solid. They often have mariachis playing on weekend nights.  Margaritas aren't great, but the beer is cold.  Don't bother with dessert.  Cheap eats for all the food, especially since you won't be hungry for another 24 hours.

We fly in from San Francisco and are told that we will have to go to another building via a bus. We get off the plane and walk...and walk...and then walk some more, looking around trying to find where to go to in order to catch this bus. Finally, we found someone who told us where to go. We walked and walked, and then walked some more until we finally caught the bus. We then had to find the correct gate and go through security again... 

Flash forward 8 days. We fly in and go through customs. (This, BTW, was a great experience because we were the only international flight going through customs.) We rechecked our luggage and are told that we have to go to another building. Yep, you know what I am about to say...we floundered around, having to ask where to go several times. Finally, we found the right place and got on the bus. It then proceeded to go to various parking lots, dropping off and picking up other passengers. My husband and I looked at each other, worried that we were on the wrong bus. Since it was already 4 p.m. and we had not had lunch, we were getting very worried that we would not have time to grab lunch. 

Finally, my husband asked the driver and he indicated that we were indeed on the right bus. We continued going around parking lots until we came upon another bus. The driver told everyone on our bus that we could sit around and wait for 10-15 minutes, or we could get on the next bus and get there quicker. Of course, we all grabbed our suitcases and boarded the next bus, which proceeded to take us to the correct stop (after picking up additional passengers along the way.) 

Next ,we entered the terminal and jumped on an elevator to take us to the security line. There were only 2 lines and of course, we got in the line with the family who had to go back 6 or 7 times because they kept trying to go through the security line with belts on, shoes on, liquids in  their suitcases...you get the picture! 

Anyway, we finally got to our gate and were able to grab a slice of pizza before boarding our plane (not before enduring the antics of a 70-year-old United Airlines power-hungry granny who couldn't seem to get her act together, but was determined to show everyone who was boss...)",1,1,3,2.5,"Positive","5"

It would've been an OK breakfast place if it wasn't for all the hype. I've been trying to visit this place since I found out it was on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives, so when I saw the deal on Doozy of a Deal, I purchased it right away. I made my own omelette with chicken, garlic, and spinach. The chicken was overcooked and the omelette and my hash browns were terribly greasy. My cousin ordered The Wolfpack and was also disappointed with her meal. It just didn't seem up to par with a place that was on Food Network.

The icing on the cake was the Over Easy Ice, their iced coffee. They could've given me a cup of water and cardamom and it wouldn't have tasted any different. We couldn't wait to get to the car to get some gum, to get the taste out of our mouths and even that didn't help. After reading other people's reviews, it looks like they hardly had any caradmom; so looks like Over Easy needs to figure out a way to uniformly make their coffee.

My party of 7 and a baby got to Pappadeux's around 6:30. We were told that it would be a 30-minute wait. It ended up being more than an hour. We were standing right in front of the hostess station, yet no one ever came to give us updates on how long it would be for our table. We would go check about every 20 or so minutes. One time we were told that our table was ready. When we went to check on it after about 20 minutes we were told that they were waiting on a busboy to clean it. A few minutes later they were still waiting on a busboy. In what universe does it take a restaurant 30 minutes to find a busboy to clean a table? We watched group after group after group get seated. A group of 7 that came after us was seated before us. We ended up being sat next to them; by the time we were getting our menus, they were finishing up their meals.

Once we were finally seated, we waited almost 10 minutes before someone came to our table to introduce himself as our waiter. When he asked how we were doing, we kindly told him that we were a little frustrated because it had taken more than twice as long as we were told, and we had been told twice that they were waiting on a busboy to clean the table. The waiter said that it was a busy night and said that he didn't get paid to deal with unhappy customers. He asked, ""So are you gonna do this or what?"" WHAT?! It was so rude - I don't know how he meant it, but it came across as sounding extremely annoyed. We were appalled and my boyfriend asked to speak to a manager.

The manager came over and spoke with my boyfriend. Not sure what was said, but after that things got much better. The manager brought us an appetizer plate on the house. Our food ended up being really good - including the alligator. I got shrimp etoufee, and it was great. The gumbo wasn't so fabulous. Overall, everyone was satisfied with their meal. We got three different drinks, and they basically tasted the same: like cherry Nyquil.

However, Kona Grill really surprised me! Especially the seafood. For a restaurant located in a mall... in Arizona... the seafood was awesome.

There are 3 important things you need to know about Kona Grill:

1. The Sea Bass is melt in your mouth, oh my god, foodgasm, amazing. Our waiter recommended it to us and I was highly skeptical. I thought that he was pushing this dish just because it's the most expensive one on the menu. Well, aside from the fact that it's the priciest item at a chain restaurant, it tastes more like a 5 star dish that would cost double the amount somewhere else. I'm telling you, YOU MUST TRY IT! It has this pan seared taste that is to die for. (I also can't forget to mention that the Salmon is super tasty as well).

2. The Cool Cucumber Mojito is not only refreshing and delicious, but it is also less than 100 calories! It's pretty strong too. This drink is pure heaven for a mojito lover like me, and it gets extra bonus points since its low calorie!  

3. Happy hour!!! It's the best and it's always packed. Kona Grill has great deals with always changing specials (I suggest checking their website before heading over).

Just try at least one of these 3 things and you'll see why I'm such a fan of this place. Overall, when it comes to dining at Fashion Square Mall, Kona Grill is pretty impressive.",2,1,0,9,"Positive","4"

Went to breakfast with Deb L, and she had a Living Social deal or one of those deal thingies. The place was packed, probably because it's a holiday week.

That doesn't excuse the EXTREMELY poor service. We sat down and waited. And waited. Servers walked by every few moments, nobody stopped to fill our water glasses or take our order. Finally, we both said something to a girl who walked by. She seems mystified that there was a job to do. With that many people working, getting a cup of coffee shouldn't take 15 minutes. Yes. 15 freaking minutes.

Food? Mediocre at best. I got the traditional eggs benedict with home fries. The only saving grace with the amount of ham on it. The English muffin didn't seem to be toasted. The eggs were *ok* but nothing great. The home fries? My 9-year old niece could do a better job. My burps right now aren't even good enough to brag about.

Valle Luna, I'm looking at you.

My family used to frequent this place - you could get a nice meal for $8 or $9 per person, and their food was fantastic.

But Valle Luna has lost a step.  You see it here and there - the chimi sauce isn't quite the same, the beans are inconsistent, and the fundido just isn't as fun.  And to make matters worse, Valle Luna now demands superstar prices, asking for around $20 for a chimichanga dinner.  I hate to break this to you, guys, but I can get that - and done better - for much cheaper.  And don't even get me started on the rise of Rito's, Chipotle, and Juan's, all of which provide superior food for less than half the price.

Their prices have become ridiculous - and I think Valle Luna knows it, because this is one of the only restaurants I can think of that creates a version of their menu WITH NO PRICES for their website.  I'm serious: http://www.valleluna.com/VL_Menu3.html  It looks exactly like the regular menu, just without any idea of how crazy expensive their food has become.  I suppose they figure that you can't (or won't) leave after you've sat down, ordered drinks, and eaten some chips?

But much like that past-his-prime athlete, Valle Luna still has one move that reminds you of those glory days, like Jordan's fade-away jumper.  It was his best shot late in his career because it was the only shot he could cleanly get off.   Valle Luna's fried ice cream is so delicious, and since it's dessert, they can't charge $18 for it.   I wish I could tell you the exact price but that's censored on the online menu, too.   

So go for dessert sometime soon and reminisce about the glory days, because I suspect it won't be long before the game passes Valle Luna by and they're forced to hang up the aprons.",0,0,2,1,"Positive","4"

Perhaps that's why they call it Black Friday, but my money was on the delicate hint of malice in the air as I stood shoulder to shoulder with  veteran soccer moms with steel and fire glinting from their eyes, Scowling teenagers and college students bubbling with nervous energy and the occasional hen-pecked dad who got talked into dealing with shopping insanity as some sort of a special treat before trudging off to the salt  mines for the day.

There were at least five hundred infantry ahead of me and five hundred behind me and our numbers kept growing.  There were scattered bits of conversation but most of us were silent, contemplating the chaos we were about to charge into for the sake of our families, our friends, our lovers.  But mostly for the sake of savings.  We glanced ahead and behind, sizing up the competition, mentally calculating our strategies for navigating the battlefield.  We were at least a battalion strong.  Perhaps a regiment by the time the doors would open.  And it would be every man woman and child for themselves.

Occasionally, someone would open a wallet or a purse, checking and rechecking their ammunition, occasionally running a finger along the edge of a bank card or bill to make sure they maintained their razor edge.  Slowly, we began to march forward and the slow but steady trudge was a stark contrast to the sense of frantic urgency that crackled in the morning air.  Not all of us could walk away victors, but all of us were determined to try.

Then something happened.  Something I would have never expected.  As we approached the double glass doors, we were greeted by another army.  With their bright blue uniforms, they could have been UN peacekeepers.  They handed us each a large plastic bag and ushered us into the store with bleary eyed smiles.  The fear and tension started to lift.  I have been at Toys R Us on Christmas eve.  I have seen the very worst of Holiday spirits and I was ready to face them again all for the sake of an (CENSORED) that (CENSORED) just had to have.

Yes the store was crowded.  But there were so many helpful, indeed cheerful sales attendants on hand that most of us shoppers just melted into a gentle wave of requests which were quickly and cheerfully met before anyone could get bent out of shape or stressed out.  A sales clerk simply asked me to wait for a moment while she located a reserve ticket for the doorbuster item I had stood in line for.  One minute and fifteen seconds later she returned with a document which guaranteed me my desired item at the desired price to be delivered to me as I left the store.  Another clerk helped me locate the other items I needed and I was done with my shopping within ten minutes.  

Of course it took another hour or so to work through the serpentine line at the checkout but all of us were so relieved at how painless and indeed bloodless the shopping experience had been. We were more than happy to stand in line waiting for the opportunity to plunk down our hard earned cash on the latest objects of technolust that had caught the eyes of our loved ones.  We left tired.  And we left poor.  But I dare say most of us left happy and for that Best Buy and the entire Best Buy army have my eternal gratitude.

While it was very nice when it first opened it's now getting a little raggedy looking and could use some updating.  Food wise this buffet is above average and definitely worth a visit.   If I could give them some advice it would be to get rid of  the HUGE salad buffet section or at least scale it way down and put that money into even more entree selections.  I've been coming here ever since they opened and hardly ever see anyone eating off the salad section.  So why spend so much money to have such a huge selection???

We both started with spring rolls - she had the salmon, I had the barbecue pork. Both looked good and mine was tasty. Then we had both had a bowl of chicken pho. It was really tasty, however expensive for pho at $10/bowl.

That said,  the food was good. Not the best Vietnamese food I've ever had, but yummy just the same. 

My only gripes were the little things. I've worked in the back of the house for a long time. So I know how much it costs to put this food together.  I just felt like everything was expensive for what it was. This is not a high end restaurant. Its a teensy little hipsterish Vietnamese place with minimal decor. Its a lunch spot essentially. My menu was printed on paper which is pretty commonplace these days so no big whoop. Unfortunately the menu looked like it had been used about 50 times. I understand re-using menus. Its totally common. To NOT do so would be environmentally irresponsible. It just looked really, really used and abused. Also, my dipping sauce ramekin had a huge chip in it. To be fair, I am hyper critical of EVERYTHING when it comes to service just because I come from a restaurant background.

I took one bite out of the California Wrap and was in Heaven!!!  The sweet flavor of Sun-Dried Tomato Vinaigrette Dressing was a perfect compliment to the Feta Cheese & Avocado....the Cole Slaw was amazing too!  What a great combo!

The only knock on this experience is that the service was kind of slow.  We had to constantly look for our waiter....to order.....to ask for extra napkins.....to get refills....to get our check.

After receiving a phone call from one of the managers regarding our visit in April, we decided to try again.  We were told they would make things right and they were very apologetic for the horrible evening we had.  (We were so irritated with the place, we waited 4 months to take him up on the offer)
As an aside, we were told we would be comped dinner due to the previous disaster.

I called ahead and spoke to Jason, who does not work at Bolero's any longer, but stated that since he was the manager at the time the incident occurred, he would make sure the new manager was aware that they needed to adhere to his promise to make things right.  Was told to call manager Desi, but no one answered.  Proceeded to the restaurant and hoped for the best.  

When we got there, as before, we stood at the front desk for between 5 and 10 minutes before anyone came to seat us.  Not a promising start.  Luckily though, that's where the lame service ended.

We had Gage as a server and he did a terrific job.  He was attentive, stopped by to fill our drinks often, checked to make sure our food was good, brought things out all at the same time, and was pleasant to deal with.  

We started with the cheese plate and it was, as before, good although probably could use some more bread with it as there are a ton of meats and cheeses and 4 small pieces of bread.  As far as the food goes, she had the spinach salad, and I had the reuben with onion rings.  Both dishes were well prepared and tasty.  We asked for a basket of bread, which was brought out with dinner.  The bread was great, but they maybe ought to consider bringing it out early, maybe just asking people if they'd like bread with their meal.  Just a suggestion.

Our only other concern as far as the menu goes is that there are not a lot of vegetarian offerings that aren't salad.  

Overall, it was a much better experience.  As we said before, Gage did a great job, and even though Jason is no longer the manager there, Dave (who was standing in for Desi, from what we were told) took care of everything.  They put effort into making this experience much better and they did a good job.  We both appreciated it and we'd go back.

We stopped at Starbucks at the Safeway next to Over Easy and got our kids a pastry each while we figured out what we'd do.  I turned to trusty yelp on my droid and they said that not only was Taylor's Cafe open, they do breakfast, and they were only about a mile from where we were.  We decided to give breakfast one more try, called Taylor's and put our names on the list.

When we arrived it was a little hard to find, but we called and they told us where it is.  The decor is cozy and inviting.  We waited at the bar for a few minutes while a table was readied, the manager was very attentive.  I told him what happened at Over Easy and he was horrified.  We live in Avondale, we're willing to drive for a good breakfast and also pay a bit more for good food and good service.  Let me tell you, Taylor's Cafe really turned the morning around for us!

My kids each ordered an apple juice, and one got chocolate chip pancakes, the other got strawberry waffles.  Their kids menu is $8 each, but the portions are huge, it's easily something an adult would put away.  I stole a bite from each, they were very tasty and there was enough for doggie bags.

My husband got a build your own omelet with 3 different cheeses and chicken sausage.  With his omelet he got 2 choices for sides, so he chose hash browns and cottage cheese (he almost went with a bagel but was pleased to hear about the cottage cheese.)  The chicken sausage was an interesting option that we had not expected.  He also ordered a mocha, which at $4 was about the size of what you'd get at Starbucks, and my husband said that it was on par with their quality.

I ordered the Joe's special, intrigued by the list of ingredients.  It was flavorful and delicious.  The country potatoes were very tasty.  I ordered the homemade raspberry lemonade, it was tangy and sweet, really tasty on a hot summer day.

We came to the decision on 4 stars because the food was good, but not out of this world.  They have fantastic options for the health conscious, and it seems to be popular with the patrons of a local gym because there were tons of people coming in work out gear.

They make a mild green curry...er, no, green sauce. Then, upon ordering, they add a certain amount of red chili flakes depending on how spicy you want it.

3 stars is an OK rating and I don't want my opinions to skew the rating scale but a 2.5 star option if available would be welcome, again I'm being nice.

This place is terrible. (I might be exaggerating)  I have heard horrible stories about the brewery in Tucson, how the beer is fine but the food is absolute crap.  I figured hey they are moving to Scottsdale in an area with an insane amount of delicious dining establishments, they have to of retooled that menu ... they didn't.  The beer honestly is good not great 4peaks IMO is at least 2x better (again being nice) but I respect a local presence and craft beer so I cant knock them for trying and building a successful brand.

That being said the food is really nothing special at all, they offer pairings like mac and cheese pizza (too gross to try) to things like salmon and steak (too fancy for here).  I tried a burger, usually safe with a mix of sweet potato and regular fries.  I also had the monkey shine which has the highest alcohol content (something I am supportive of) and even after that beer the food disappointed (how can that be?!).  It wasn't that the burger was horrible but it just wasn't anything special, it was bland and I got the western that had tons of stuff on it.   The biggest problem was the fries which ironically seemed to come out of the frozen food section of a local Frys Food and Drug (not even a signature, Kroger brand - house brand aka the worst).  A friend joining me had the wings, the wings were actually pretty good but they were wings and wings are gonna be good in a place like this especially after some beer so I feel that we should take that for what its worth.

The pasties I order are REALLY good... They have a fine beer selection (including Mickey's Big-Mouths) and a few cocktail options... Most of the sides and desserts are pretty solid.

I tend to stick with and very much enjoy the more traditional pasties like The Oggie, and the Cottage Pie (OK, OK... I love the Royale with Cheese, too). However, some of the ""premium"" pasties like the Pesto Chicken and the Salmon pasty are a bit funky to me. 

Even that, I can write off to personal preference.

What really keeps the CPC from getting another star or two is the restaurant itself. 

It's a long, narrow space, 75% of which is divided by a bar. Seating is along the wall or at the bar, with a few larger tables in the back. 

On the other side of the bar from the customers is where ALL of the restaurant operations take place; cooking, cleaning, prep, and bar. If one is sitting at the bar, this intersection of consumption with infrastructure is often a bit too much like watching sausage being made. 

I don't really expect a fine dining experience at a place like the Cornish Pasty, but I really don't need to hear the dishes crashing into the sink and i don't need to see all the potential for cross-contamination (food preparation right next to the dirty dishes and raw meat right next to the beer glasses). 

My worst experience was arriving late and sitting at the bar while they were cleaning the ""kitchen"" area and still serving food. It was really noisy, the refrigerator light kept blinding me, and the smell of cleaning chemicals was so strong that it made it impossible for me to even think about enjoying the pasty. I walked out after about 4 bites...

I've wanted to go back several times, because I do enjoy the food and beer options, and finally went back last Friday. The food was as good as it's ever been but the environment will still make me think 2 or 3 times before heading back.

"3396","bJAJyoT04GwOatS4UVX90Q","3","I found myself in Phoenix for a week. I prefer Marriott, but a co-worker insisted on Hilton....and then didn't go on the trip. Nice.

Anyway, the stay was a hodgepodge of experiences. 

Downsides: The room was nondescript on the whole, but the neck of the shower was pulled partly out of the wall and the shower curtain was partly torn and had red (?!?) mold on it. I didn't have a car, so the parking lot didn't bother me, but the area on one side of the hotel was sketchy and had a fair amount of undesirable foot traffic. The nearest station to get on the light rail was 3 blocks either way from the hotel.

Upsides: The staff was friendly and super-helpful in recommending EXCELLENT restaurants, including hole-in-wall, genuine Mexican joints. The hotel has a shuttle van that will, if you reserve it or can snag a ridealong, take you anywhere within five miles of the hotel for free, and then pick you up again. Naturally you should tip the driver (also a great guy), but it still beats taking a cab. The driver gets bonus points for letting us jump out and grab a coffee on the way to our destination! It also is only 1.5 blocks from Fez, a fantastic restaurant. 

I was not knocked out by the facility, but the people were great. I'll still probably stay a Marriott user when I return, but I'll sure consider the Garden Inn again.",2,3,0,2,"Positive","4"

I don't mind coming here, I really like their Mac and Cheese.
You can get it with or without chicken.........years ago the chicken was this really thin shaved peppered chicken and I thought it was awful so I have since always ordered without chicken.

However today Hubby chose the mac and chicken and I was surprised that now they use real chunks of shredded chicken breast!! YAY! 
What and improvement!! It was really good! (see pics)
. 

I got  the Turkey Bacon Cobb sandwich minus bacon =Layers of juicy oven-roasted turkey breast on grilled sourdough bread with sweet peppered bacon, sliced avocado, roasted tomatoes, sprouts and mixed greens. Topped with rosemary dressing and Bleu cheese crumbles (see pics)

It was better  than I expected, they forgot to put avocado on it though and
the bread was really really good and for being grilled it wasnt over saturated with grease.

As others have noted, be prepared to wait a while for service and don't be afraid to go get your waiter if you're feeling abandoned. Also, there may be a wait for a table, and the environment is loud, so be prepared to shout a bit if it's busy. 

They have beer-tasting on certain nights. I did not partake, but my Dad (who was visiting AZ) did. The food varies in quality (or perhaps just varies in quality of recipe?). My Orange Table friend and I shared a 'special' pork chop dish, and that was pretty blah. However, I highly recommend their grilled cheese sandwich on some sort of yummy bread (the lower end cheese sandwich ~ I have yet to try the fancy one). 

As for breakfast, I don't recall it being particularly spectacular, but I think it was better than your average diner breakfast. I may have to go back to try again... The flavored iced coffee seems very evil and full of calories, but it is really quite good. That did stand out!

Once we sat down, our moods immediately improved. Our waiter was friendly, funny and attentive, without being overbearing or annoying. I was happy to see a decent selection of beers with a healthy dose of local brews. I immediately ordered an Oak Creek Nut Brown.

Our waiter quickly brought our drinks and glasses of water with cucumber slices. The cucumber added a nice cooling touch on a hot summer day.

We ordered the sweet potato fries and I ordered a seafood burger, which on that particular day was shrimp. The sweet potato fries were excellent, fried just right and lightly seasoned with kosher salt. Even without the homemade ketchup, the fries were a delight.

My burger was tasty, with the shrimp lightly breaded and seasoned with a kicky teriyaki sauce and served on the bun with lettuce and thin strips of carrots. Also, the bun was very soft and tasty.

The only issue with Stax is the price. The burgers are more like tapas, in that they're small (3 oz). But, each burger ranges from $4 to $7, depending on the type of meat. A hungry person could easily eat three burgers, so plan to spend a decent amount of money if you want a large meal here.

When my boss first told me about this place, I thought he said ""Al Molina"" and I was like, ""You mean the guy who played Doc Ock in Spider-Man II?""

I've been here a few times, today was the first time I'd been to El Molino in about 8 months.  I happened to be in the area, popping in to buy a backpack at Staples an decided to get a burrito to go to munch on when I got back to my office.

One thing I really didn't like was that you had to ask for the key to use the bathroom.  That's something very typical of, like, a gas station that bums use to shit on the floor.  I went to the bathroom and it said I had to ask for the key.  I went back to the counter and the woman disappeared in the back so I kinda just did a little pee-pee dance until she came back.

It was a little too expensive for what it was.  A thing of chips was like $4.50.  That's crazy.  Granted, the chips are really good and you get a lot of em, but... don't you have a thing of chips I can buy for a buck that comes with a much more reasonable portion?  I got all these chips in the fridge at work that won't be edible on Monday, probably.

The burrito I got was very tasty.  The salsa they gave me was also super good.  Nice and smokey and spicy.  Seriously.  Man, that shit was spicy.  I kind of have a soar throat today so that spiciness felt super good to me.

I had to laugh when I opened up my to-go back once I got back to work because I actually thought maybe I didn't get ANY salsa, but when I took a look they gave me soooo much.  I made a small tower beside my meal, like a Stonehenge of heat.

So I bought a bra online to pick up at the store, but when I went in and tried it on, it didn't fit. I thought that sizes for that brand ran a little differently. I told the sales girl, and she asked me if I minded if she measured me. I said sure and she followed me into the dressing room. 

When we got in there she told me to take off my top! I'll be honest here, I thought she was going to measure me over my shirt, and I almost peed a little. I decided to pretend like it was no big deal to take my top off in front of a total stranger, and just took it off. Not sure if she noticed my slight hesitation, but she probably did, oh well. I generally like to go on a couple of dates before I take my top off if you know what I am saying.

Well guess what? That is the best way to get a good measurement it turns out! The salesgirl told me to wait a few moments and she would be back with some bras. She came back with two of the most wonderful, comfortable, and supportive bras I have ever owned! So instead of getting one bra that day, I got two.

I have to say, my hat (or my top) is off to Nordstrom for training their staff to be great at their jobs, and for having fabulous bras.

It looks as if Yogurtini is pretty well-loved around these parts, and I'm sorry to report otherwise. It's was like a bomb had gone off. The tables were filthy, the machine handles were all gunked up, there was assorted debris on the floor. The two teenagers working were too busy gossiping about who knows what to do their jobs. When we walked in there were a few customers sampling flavors among the ruins, with no employees in sight. We grabbed some sample cups from the register and dodged napkins and froyo puddles (and other customers) to try some different flavors. The levers are the type that if you pull just a bit too far you make a mess all over your hand, especially when trying to squirt a tiny bit in a sample cup. This mess is then added to the greater mess of everyone else attempting this same operation, and no-one attempting to clean it up.

The stuff was real overpowering, to where instead of tasting like what it was supposed to taste like, it was bordering on medicine or like a bad imitation of what it was supposed to be. Like, cheesecake doesn't taste like that, good cheesecake anyway... And neither does cake batter, or banana. Where did the yogurt part go? And how do you screw up cookies and cream, exactly? The two that were the best (and most edible) were the Irish mint and the red velvet, and that's what we mostly ended up with.

The decor didn't add to our experience. Everything is a mint green, but it doesn't come off as retro or even minty, but more like dated and hospital-like. Some people really like it but I found it unappetizing.

A surly teenager magically appeared as we approached the register, only to disappear again soon after we paid. We sat down at a dirty table and dealt with our choices while the two teens again made an appearance, half-mopping-half-attempting-to-clean while chattering back and forth about their dating woes.

"3504","8-kxb-aC1BLteINrTrxrNw","4","The name says it all.  This family owned restaurant (3 to be exact) specializes in tortas but they also carry your staple Mexican fast-food affair you would find in AZ.  Everything I or anyone else has had has been solid.  Just in case you don't know what a torta is, the best way I can explain what one is that it is essentially a toasted sandwich with a fusion of Mexican and American ingredients.  When it comes to TEG's tortas, there are a few standouts.  One would be the cochinita.

Cochinita which is marinated pork is absolutely delicious by itself, but in a torta, it is absolutely scrumptious!!!  My best description of what cochinita is to think of pulled pork that is braised in a slightly sweet, salty, and spicy redish/orangeish sauce.  In addition, it has American sandwich staples such as mayo, shredded lettuce.  What makes it a ""torta"" are the slices of sweet and sour pickled jalapenos and carrots and slices of avocado (and they do not skimp).  What completes the sandwich, I mean torta, is the bread.  It's always warm and fluffy in the inside and the outside always has a nice crisp texture from the grill.
 
The other torta I would strongly recommend is the carne asada.  The combination of the carne asada steak with mayo, fresh pico de gallo, and lettuce along with the warm bread makes this torta an absolute winner (my mouth is actually watering just thinking about it!).

The Cubana, which has your typical ingredients that come with any spin on the classic Cuban, is also good.  If you are a big fan of Cubans, then this one may be for you. But in my humble opinion, this does not anywhere near come close to the yummy goodness of the cochinita and carne asada.

The Hawiiana (Hawaiian) is also a relative good choice.  With the combination of Ham and fresh grilled pineapple along with other condiments, it also is descent selection.

As I stated before, they do have staple Arizona style Mexican fast-food here and there are a few I would recommend.  One would be the flautas (large deep fried rolled tacos).

The pollo is the one I would suggest.  If you envision your typical fried rolled tacos with guacamole and cheese, well this is not that, this is even better!  The flautas at TEG are larger with much more stuffing then your typical rolled tacos.  In addition, they make them with yummy flour tortillas, not your typical corn.  The shredded chicken is well seasoned and moist.  The tortilla is always fried perfectly, light crisp on the outside with the inside of the tortilla still soft.

The burritos here are good, actually better than average, but because the tortas here are the showcase, everything else takes a backseat.  The rice and beans are hit and miss, especially at the Chandler location.

I used to give TEG four and a half stars, but with the mistake of expanding too quickly, combined with quality and consistency falling a bit, I would have to give them three and half stars; four stars would be stretching. I'm anal so three and three quarter seems to fit.

For example, the Phoenix location, which the Son runs and where he started the chain has a few issues.  For example, the Cochinita at the Phoenix location is always drier and saltier than the other two locations.  In addition, they have certain items only at that location that the other two do not.  One would be their Sonoran style hotdogs, which are excellent and an item I would highly recommend.  When I have gone to both the Mesa and Chandler location and asked for them, and unfortunately they said they don't carry them.  I was disappointed to say the least. 

Another example of inconsistency is the last time I went to the Chandler location.  I brought a couple of out of town guests, and I was a little disappointed because the bread was a little too bready (dense) and not light and fluffy as usual.  When all the ingredients are in perfect symphony, you have one amazing torta, but when one ingredient is off such as something like the bread being too dense throws off that harmonious balance of flavors and textures.  In this case, it made a difference from a four and half star sandwich to a 3 star sandwich (which is still good in my book, but not great).

The best and most consistent is their Mesa location.  I think that it is because Mom and Pops run that particular location (well they used to anyways).  Everything has always been consistently delici-oh-so-good.

Overall, would I still recommend Tortas El Guero, and do I still go?  Yes, but I wouldn't rave about the place like I once did especially with the inconsistencies I've experienced as of late.

Highlights:

The Grilled Wings were very good.   Nice and crisp, charred but not burned, and not too fatty.  I could have eaten two dozen of them.
The Cheddar Potatoes were a hit at the table, liked by all.
The Creme Brulee was excellent, and about twice the size that Torched Goodness offers, for 5 cents less than TG charges.

Lowlights:

The hummus was just plain, and there was something else they put on top of it, something a little bitter - ??  Not sure what it was, but it was not impressive.
The ""half rack"" of ribs were pretty tiny for $14.95.  Not a lot of meat.
The Flatiron Steak was also tiny, and overcooked.  Not very tasty at all.
Mashed potatoes and Mac-N-Cheese were very pedestrian.

We came in about 3pm and it was pretty crowded. The pizza oven was going, and there were lots of people sitting around eating gelato. A lot more crowded than the last time we came in, that's for sure. We ordered lunch, I got the marinara pizza and my husband ordered the chopped salad. The wait time for our lunch was pretty minimal. A little over five minutes. My pizza came out first and it was pretty delicious. The crust was thin, with just the right amount of fluffy in the edges, and with a nice char on the bottom from the pizza oven. The sauce was tangy and had a nice array of spices in it. It was also covered in garlic and fresh basil leaves. I really enjoyed this pizza. My husbands salad was lettuce, chopped carrots, cucumbers, roasted corn, cherry tomatoes, parm, all in a very tasty vinaigrette on top of a piece of flat bread. His salad was also very delicious. Our coupon covered our whole meal plus two small scoops of gelato, but the prices of our lunches was pretty reasonable. I would come back here to eat the food again.

The gelato on the other hand, is still not my favorite. I had strawberry today and didn't finish it again. I don't know what it is about the gelato here, but I am just not crazy about it. Hence the four stars. The pizza and salads are great though. Come try those.",0,1,0,7,"Positive","4"

We had the soft pretzel appetizer which was ok, but I'm spoiled when it comes to pretzels having lived in Philly and lived on them for my entire college career.   I wish it came with a honey mustard to dip in and not just regular spicy mustard.  I had the French Dip which was solid - not the best I've had but still pretty good.

"3546","z5DWuWiYaZYmzI0T-bi0eg","2","This is tough, because I REALLY wanted to like this place! What killed it for me? The lack of professionalism that was presented when my fiance and I came to look at this venue. I will admit that we were 10 minutes late to our appointment, however I do not think this warrants being treated like a herd of cattle.

First when I called the venue to make an appointment whoever picked up the line sounded as if they were in a rush and not even interested in making the appointment which was the first turn off. Upon arrival, we walked into another entrance thinking it was the main entrance, then we were re-directed by an employee to the adjacent door. As we walked out there was (I don't even remember her name), the wedding coordinator waiting. She quickly greeted us then had us sit down as she began to talk about the venue. 

Usually when you want to sell the venue you run, you'd think you would see someone with a little enthusiasm and fire explaining why their venue is so amazing. Well, we didn't get that from this individual. What did we get? A quick 10 minute spiel about what they do and the services provided and 3 wedding books shoved in our faces as examples then a quick 10 minute tour of the place. That's it, no effort, no emotion, no interest in wanting to get to 'know us' and get a feel for what kind of wedding we would like to have, just a quick, here is the place, goodbye. She was very snooty and acted as if she was not in the mood to showcase the venue.

So why two stars instead of zero? One star is for the venue itself. It is very chic, modern, yet elegant. The reception area is beautifully decorated and where the ceremony is held is beautiful as well! There are many ways one can decorate this place! The other star is the PRICE. This venue offers all inclusive packages at unbeatable prices. I mean an all inclusive package where they provide virtually everything for roughly 100 guests is $9495.00 taxes and gratuity included!!! That's a steal, trust me, I've looked into a TON of venues, you will not find an all inclusive price as cheap as this.

I have been anxiously awaiting the opening of this spot, since I frequent the other spots on the same corner.  I had some pretty high hopes that this might end up rivaling Postino's or Bomberos... or well... something other than a drive-thru.

I ordered the daily flatbread pizza.  It was a Chicken Teriyaki with prosciutto, pineapple and red jalapenos.  The ingredients didn't seem to be of the best quality.  The chicken was a little gristly (sliced breast meat would have been nice), and the cheese was unspeakable.  It was straight-from-a-bag mozzarella... which was congealed into a huge mass of grease.  The pizza was so wet with sauce and grease and heavy from too many toppings, that I couldn't even identify the crust... it was disintegrating before my eyes.  The prosciutto was all in one large clump, instead of being sprinkled throughout.  So disappointing.  My friend's caprese salad was mainly a plate of tomatoes with a garnish of cheese and a sprig of basil.  I love a good caprese - and especially enjoy when there is a fairly equal amount of all ingredients.  Helps balance out each bite, you know?  No such luck with this one!

"3597","aR-UGCJCHqF3kB_DjWKrWQ","4","this is my favorite music venue in phoenix. it is a smaller venue best for local or indie bands, but every show i've been to their has been far more memorable then any show i've been to in phoenix.

the place itself isn't too stunning, it is just a rectangular brick building with a bar area on the right when you walk in, booths on the left side of the wall, some high tables in the middle, a stage and standing area at the back, and an eclectic mix of art on the walls. however, the place has a really good feel to it and excellent sound that leads to really wild and memorable concerts.

the two that i remember the most were the presets/the rapture and spinto band/art brut/we are scientists. i thought the presets were pretty lousy until i saw them play there and the rapture played an absolutely amazing set that lasted almost 2 hours and inspired an epic, comfortably out-of control dance party. the other show was equally long and boisterous, highlighted by eddie argos coming out into the crowd to sing 3 songs.

the bad things about the place are that last time i went there was still no alcohol because they lost their liquor license. however, i heard that they have got it back now, but i'm not sure. the shows i went to i had to go down the street between sets and drink at alice cooperstown which isn't cheap. 

it also doesn't have a patio at all where you can hang out and hear the music or what is going on inside and drink or smoke. the venue reminds me alot of the lounge in the back of Plush in tucson except for the lack of a patio which is really important in a state like AZ where the weather is so good at night most of the year.

of course the worst thing is just the lack of bands that go there. most bands come to either marquee (heaven help us poor phoenicians) or even worse, the clubhouse. if you happen to be a tour manager reading reviews on yelp, please book your band at the brickhouse.

Update - 8/31 - Had to downgrade to 4 stars after my most recent visit. Its hard to believe that I'm downgrading them now that they have liquor available, but it's happening. 

They normally have local draft brews at this place for 2 dollars, but apparently when they have a show they don't sell it at all. Only bottles for 3 or 4 dollars. What's worse is that every bottle I ordered wasn't cold, tasted like they just threw it in the ice bin 30 minutes before. AND they kept running out of beers. What's even worse is that the mixed drinks run 6 DOLLARS for a really tiny glass. This place needs to get its act together. I'll be drinking beforehand and elsewhere in between sets from now on. I don't get why the music venues in Phoenix don't understand how much more money they can make at a show with drink specials.

They also apparently haven't invested in air conditioning which makes summer shows not even worth it. Okkervil River still put on a great show to my surprise, which is the only thing (along with the other great shows i've seen there) that kept me downgrading this place to 3 stars or lower.

The food is fresh.  While it's not amazing fish, there's nothing wrong with it - nothing here to get sick from.
All the standards are readily available and if you want something not already on the belt, they'll gladly make it for you.
The conveyor really feeds into my lack of patience.  I sat down, ordered an iced green tea, and started pulling plates off the belt.  Yes, I was eating sushi within 90 seconds of sitting down!
The price is a HUGE plus!  I met a friend for lunch - we each had iced tea, several plates with 3 or 4 roll slices, seaweed salad, sunumono salad and a couple nigiri and I was out of there for less than $20, including tip.
The place is kept incredibly clean, staff is friendly and Teharu fills a nice niche for a super casual, quick sushi place.  When it comes down to it, I can't always afford to spend what that quantity of food would cost me at Yasu or any of the other great places in town - I like that I am not committing to a whole roll - I can sample from 5 or 6 different ones.

"3626","eeZLCm4v-dtSH0x3KoFUBw","5","Changing Hands is the perfect bookstore. These types of places just don't seem to exist, but Changing Hands has managed to survive.

Allow me to begin by saying that this bookstore does not have anywhere near the selection of a Barnes and Noble (or probably a Borders, but I don't go into that garbage store and cannot be sure). With that said, there are a few reasons to shop here.

First, and most importantly, they have well priced used books. I believe most of their used books are $7.50. They are also all in pristine condition. Now, $7.50 used isn't always that great for a paperback. You can do better online quite often. What's notable, however, is that their hardcovers are typically $7.50 as well. This is a fantastic price and is hard to beat.

Second, the location of CH is perfect. This is one of the best plazas out there. Wildflower, Trader Joe's, Mac's, Jamba Juice--you can't go wrong.

Third, and finally, Changing Hands is a local store, and many good things come with that. The staff is extremely friendly. From what I can tell, they are all hardcore book nerds and you have to love that. The store also has a very welcoming feel to it. Once you're in, you will realize how extremely friendly everyone is. No, not just the staff--the customers. Everyone is talkative, friendly, and just seems to be happy. They are all indulging in one of their hobbies in one of the most inviting stores I have ever seen. Someone will ask the staff ""who wrote such and such?"". The staff will almost assuredly spot a regular and ask him or her  ""who wrote such and such"". If he doesn't know, someone else will  probably pipe up. It's this type of thing that makes it a great store. Overall, it just has a great atmosphere.

The only negative comment I can make about Changing Hands is how hippy it is. There's a ton of books on spiritual techniques, new age methods, buddhism, and whatever the hell else hippies/hipsters think makes them look more cultured. Of course, this just goes along with the Tempe, Trader Joe's, and book reading demographic, so I can't blame them for meeting the inherent demand.",0,0,0,7,"Positive","5"

My dog has food allergies so I'm cautious about changing her food quickly but since it was about 7 pm and I was pretty much out of food on this day, I figured some food would be better than no food.  

During my visit I learned many things.  Apparently Canidae is a inferior brand and ripped off its ingredients and packaging from Innova.  Innova is a far, far superior dog food.  Innova is awesome, Canidae is for chumps.  Innova is also more expensive and a smaller bag.  Nothing I couldn't afford but annoying none the less. Not wanting to create dog food controversy I bought a bag of the morally superior Innova.

But when I checked out I was asked about four times whether I realized I was buying nibbles instead of bits.  ""You know you have the nibbles. Are you sure you want nibbles?  We have bits if your dog prefers bits"".

"3650","3NzDi8_xfY9BxKWMbeudPg","4","the things I liked:

the cart.
 it was much smaller than a regular shopping cart, but somehow our  baby carrier fit in it with-wise. * Update ( they got rid of the small carts.)
You can fill it up and not spend $300. This has happened to me before at Fry's, and its a bummer.
Since they are new, they are the cleanest they will ever be. I have a huge dirty cart handle issue. F&E like most grocery stores have the disinfectant wipes but that grosses me out more for some reason.
the steering on the carts was easy like ikea's carts with out the crazy hydroplane maneuver.

The food.
Everything F&E brand had very minimal marketing on the packaging which made me feel like i was purchasing it for the quality of food, not how nice the fake prepared image on the front looked. 
I have yet to taste it though, ill update when I do. * Update (Prepared food is kinda hit or miss)
They have only 1 or maybe 2 brands of the same exact item which makes decisions easy, either you want it or don't, no comparing labels and whatnot. which makes you end up buying less stuff.
It also makes for a shorter trip to the grocery store. No more putting off going to the market. Even though I have managed to make myself only shop the outside of the gigantic grocery stores (Produce, meat, dairy bakery) it still takes a long time to trek through the store.

Last grabs.
If you needed  they have a small pharmacy aisle grocery brand pet food, and baby care/household aisle. shampoo.... whatever.

One of these things is not like the other...
so the chip aisle has F&E brand chips and cookies and all nicely packaged and then at the end were flaming hot Cheeto's? maybe thats the part where they sell local goods. frito-lay is the best we have?

They do not take American express and watch out for the fine print on the coupons. * Update ( They now accept AMEX)

$.
Somethings cost much less than at normal markets, and some were the exact same. 
they also discount Items that are close to their expiration, so you can go ahead and grab that milk instead of pulling 3 out looking for the latest expiration. same thing with baked goods, meat products and produce.

"3687","x0x4lsz_9BT-Hjr7TrzMKA","2","I went to Eddie's House last night with the BF and two friends for restaurant week and it was a terrible experience. First of all, I had made a reservation for 7:30 more that a week in advanced and we waited until 7:50 to be seated. This was a bad omen, because, as it turns out, the whole night was made up of waiting. Our waiter (who did not share his name, unfortunately because I would tell anyone to avoid him at all costs) was terrible. TERRIBLE. He came by 4 times before taking our order when we were ready after 5 minutes. Each time was a weird excuse. First time he came by I asked for a restaurant week menu, he said 'a restroom menu?' Why would I say that, then I ordered a glass of moscato and he's like the XXXX (whatever brand it was) and i looked down and it was the ONLY moscato.... I was like ya... WTF? So I screamed what I wanted and he's like oh.... sorry.... I can't hear. Then he said 'Oh hey, I'll be back to explain things.' Explain what? we're clearly ready! 'Oh hey, are you ready to order? Well let me go take the order of that big table back there and I'll be back to take yours' (real quote) WHAT? Seriously? We waited over 40 minutes to order. What's worse, is that we looked over like where the ef is this guy, and he was chatting at the bar!!! What, were we not wearing the right clothes? Were we not hip enough to be served? Or was it that we were ordering off the restaurant week menu, are we not ordering enough to get service? Come on.

 So he finally took our order, and we each ordered all three courses at once, because who knew when he would decide to come back. We got drinks, everyone got beer, except me who ordered the moscato. This was good, but was served in basically a thimble, it was the smallest glass of wine I have ever seen. Then we waited... and waited... and waited. We ate the whole basket of bread (which was great, but overshadowed by our terrible service). We got our appetizers, we had at least one of each available (a peach soup, a salmon flat bread, and a fetoush salad). The soup was really weird, not bad, just different. The salad was overpoweringly oniony, but still tasted good, although it was supposed to have toasted pita and had one tiny piece... and supposedly the flat bread was good, but I don't like salmon, so I didn't try it. Then the waiter came by and said 'oh we're really busy tonight, that's why it's taking a long time for the food) Notice there was no apology or accommodation of any kind. He also asked if we wanted bread with dinner, we said yes, but no bread ever came... weird. 

We waited and waited and finally out food came. I ordered the chili chicken, the two boys ordered the meatloaf, and my other friend ordered the shrimp. I thought the chicken had a good flavor, but was really dry. The meatloaf was fantastic! It was really quite delicious, with onion strings, mushroom jus, and mashed potatoes... yum. Supposedly the shrimp were really spicy, but again, I didn't try it. We ate everything, so again, the food was good, the service was awful. 

So then the waiter comes by (about 10-15 min after we had finished) and says, oh do you still want dessert? um.... yes, we ordered it and it comes with our meal.... he says 'oh, cuz I think we just ran out of the pot de creme, but I'll look' Well two people had ordered the pot de creme TWO HOURS AGO!!!! Why weren't they left aside? 'Oh we had 200 more people show up tonight that expected' Well, We had a reservation, so it is not our fault that you cannot staff your restaurant appropriately or turn away customers when you are too busy to handle new diners. It does not make sense. What kind of greedy restaurant is this that they can't refuse a table when people who told them they came to eat there can't even get anything off the dessert menu. It turned out they had one left, then the other person who ordered it said, oh ok, i'll have the peach crisp then....'oh, well we're out of that too cuz like it's made fresh from peaches and we didn't buy enough for all of the extra people....' 

Maybe if we had been served in a TIMELY manner instead of over two and a half hours, they wouldn't have run out. Oh, and maybe if the jerk who was our server had put aside the desserts for us when we ordered it over TWO HOURS before the time when we actually got dessert, that would have been nice too. The desserts were good, the pot de creme was the best, the rest of us got a 'tiramisu' which tasted like cookie dough ice cream.... not exactly what I want in a tiramisu, but fine, I guess. 

Finally, we get the check (around 200$, so clearly we didn't spend enough money to warrant any service) and we right out how we want the bill split between the two couples, The waiter comes by, and the BF starts saying, oh we wrote down the amounts we want on each card. The snarky jerk waiter says 'Oh, you mean follow the directions, ok.' So much attitude! So rude. I wish we left no tip, cuz that's what was deserved. NEVER AGAIN.",2,2,1,9,"Positive","5"

Downtown Glendale is similar to downtown Scottsdale but 1/10th the size and capacity.  There are tons of little shops in a historic district with ONE parking garage and whats worse is you will pass many empty lots that they pay cops to stand around just to make sure you dont park there.  I finally ask a police officer where CAN we actually park.  Anyway, the event was cool with lots for the kids, it is a farmers market that sells food you would find at the fair thrown in with some chocolate vendors, jumpers and carnival type rides for the kids in separate areas that require separate tickets for each area (this was way annoying too).  Glendale could do better by putting up directories everywhere for people to know where they are, where bathrooms are, and they could spread things out and offer more space per human being (I am sure this place is stupid in the evening).  Plus they need to do something about parking, even if they build a HUGE garage and charge $20 a car at least there would be options for people who dont want to walk a mile before they walk around for miles....

However, the ONE thing that bothered me was the reception staff.  I was mistreated.  I say this because I asked the reception staff a question about the pool hours and the response I received was ""Are you a guest here?""  Followed by ""because we get a lot of people around here...""  While that response is completely understandable, I must point out that I checked in an hour earlier with the SAME staff at the desk.  This may be me sounding like a self-centered, remember me-type of person, but no.  I felt that the receptionist was categorizing me because of my age and because of my look.  I guess I just look like the type that would crash into a hotel pool?  Mind you, this Residence Inn is adjacent to the Mayo Clinic and desert land.  Yes, the only two things around walking distance are this hotel and the hospital.  So apparently, this hotel pool must be the hot spot for pool crashers.  Must be all the sickly patients that want to take a dip in the pool.  

Then on the same occasion, the same reception staff told me that they did not have a bottle opener at the desk.  There is a small convenient store next to the reception desk that sells wine, beer, water, soda, snacks, etc.  I purchased a beer and asked them if they had a bottle opener so I could drink my beer by the fire pits and they said no.  It had been misplaced.  Some time later, the nice gentleman that helped me open my beer got beers at the reception desk and somehow, they magically had a bottle opener.

We were recommended to visit this place by the entertainer for the evening, a belly dancer.  Efes isn't your typical sit-down restaurant -- in fact, you may have to kneel down.  The environment is to set a casual Turkish dinner setting.  If you have a big party, some of you may be sitting on the floor...don't worry, there are plenty of pillows.

The entertainment was good (if you like belly dancing) and the music was interesting.  Our party of 4 opted for the super sampler to start and the Efes mix to share.

I personally like this type of food.  Exotic, full of spices, not your typical meats.  My wife didn't necessarily find it great, but ate some and didn't complain :-).  I think the Doner Kabob was the best.  If you go with a group, the Efes mix was a great way to try a little of everything and was plenty of food for our party of 4.",0,0,0,4,"Positive","4"

"3746","SOSvQkisnm_wDu9H9k6SyQ","1","My love affair with Pita Jungle is a long one.....perhaps longer than any other restaurant, certainly longer than I can remember, and at least for the adult portion of my life, which is why it pains me to write this review. 

For the last 6 months, I have ordered takeout one day a week from this location, typically on a Friday or Saturday. The ridiculousness that has become my adult life has necessitated a heavy reliance on takeout for my main source of nourishment. Although the food is always spot on at Pita, my takeout experience has been anything but. 

The prior 3 out of 4 times I went to pick up my food, I ended up waiting past the promised time. Now I'm not unreasonable, waiting 5 or 10 minutes is not a big deal, but each time has been a wait of 25 to 30+ minutes past the pick up time, with no apologies or explanations. I was beginning to wonder if they had ever started cooking my food before I got there. The last time I must've looked really irritated, because I was offered an obligatory baklava for my wait. 

Used to the wait, I started showing up 5 to 10 minutes past the promised time, just as preventative maintenance. Imagine my surprise when my order was ready as promised thie time. I left with my bag of food and a smile on my face. I get back to my friend's house, open the bag, and begin to realize just how badly the order has been screwed up. We ordered 4 items, 3 of which were wrong. I load one item up and head back to Pita. Making me wait a ridiculous amount of time for my food is one thing, but blatantly screwing up my order is too much. As I explain my situation to the takeout girl, she goes to get the Manager who proceeds to inform me that I ordered it wrong. As I struggle to keep my cool, I inform them that they must be mistaken. One item was ordered with chicken, my item was turkey, and the other two were salads. Everything came with chicken. The salads were for my vegetarian friends, and I'm allergic to chicken. There's no way you're going to convince me I ordered chicken for myself and two vegetarians. Sorry, try again. Without too much ado, the correct dishes were provided, and yet another obligatory baklava was offered. I declined. There is only so much wrong that baklava can right. Don't get me wrong, their baklava is amazing, but it's not going to make up for them screwing up my order, then trying to blame it on me. Oh, and did I mention that they gave me a coupon for a free appetizer? Too bad the coupon expires in a few days. 

I'm afraid I will be taking my weekly Friday takeout business elsewhere, until enough time has passed that maybe, just maybe, I can find it in my heart to forgive Pita Jungle. In the meantime, I suggest you try to get it together down there. In case you missed the count, that's 4 out of the last 5 takeouts you missed the mark on, including 1 you tried to blame on me. That's shameful.",0,0,0,-4,"Negative","1"

To the food, we concur with almost everyone here. It was impeccable! We ordered the ice tower for 2 and thought that it was very well presented. Ours came with 3 appetizers (raw oysters, crab claws and dungeness crab) so it wasn't too high. They are all fresh. Growing up I used to go to the beach quite often just to have fresh crabs, so I know what those taste like. And for 6 years living in the desert, Mastro's is the first and only one in AZ to deliver that.  

For main course, I got Ivory Salmon ""Oreganata"", bf got Swordfish blackened. I am quite picky when it comes to fish, and bf isn't exactly a fish person, but both of our dishes ""surpassed expectation."" I couldn't say much about swordfish except it was fresh. We had the same dish 2 weeks before at somewhere else, it was nowhere near as sweet and fresh as the one at Mastro's. It was my first having Ivory Salmon, it was sweeter, and white (hence the name) than normal salmon we get around here. Mine was good size portion, firm to the touch, but melted in the mouth. The flavor was subtle enough to enjoy by itself, or you can add one of the sauces provided. One of my favorite sauces of the night I think was made of minced tomatoes and olives, came with the main course.

Sides were Lobster Mash and Snap peas. I didn't really care for snap peas as I can make them at home. But lobster mash is a MUST for those who go there. I'm not sure how they prepared it, but it felt like mash potatoes made with lobster bisque (instead of water and milk) and added lobster chunks. It was much more flavorful and creamy than a normal mash potatoes. It was big enough to share and take home. One thing though, it hardened up after sitting out for awhile, so I'm not sure if microwave could make it all fluffy again after 1 night in the fridge.

Drinks there are amazing, from the presentation, to the taste, and definitely the amount of alcohol in each drink. We decided to go with cocktail drinks rather than wines because of other yelpers' reviews. Total worth it!!!

The service was amazing. We had Robert. We pretty much asked him for recommendations for everything, yet he was nice about it and very knowledgeable. Next time we go back, I would definitely ask for him again.

We didn't order dessert since they gave us a dark-chocolate ""Happy Anniversary"" cake with the letters written, also, in chocolate. The overall experience was 4 3/4, just because it was a bit difficult talking to each other. The acoustic of the room wasn't very good and it got loud. Didn't see much of cougar/manther scene as we were in the dining room. And maybe it was during weekdays, we saw lots of ""expense account"" people though",0,2,0,9.5,"Positive","4"

My boyfriend on the other hand was raised by two Phd holding physicists and studied electrical engineering in college. He has weird accelerometer-type machines in his garage and has conversations that would make the cast of the Big Bang Theory proud. Kudos to the Arizona Science Center for offering exhibits that appealed to the both of us.

We started on the 4th floor at the Solarville exhibit which focused on energy, the environment, and conservation. It talked about individual household energy usage, and ways to reduce environmental impact. The 3rd floor had the Forces of Nature and Technology exhibits, which both offered interactive and informative displays. The 2nd floor was all about electricity, so naturally my electrical engineer bf showed off his knowledge. The coolest part of the museum for me was the first floor at the ""All About Me"" exhibit. It covers the systems of the human body and even has a stomach you can walk through and a giant nose that blows out objects. The neuroscience portion was very interesting, and I enjoyed taking the interactive memory tests.

Admission was $14, not including special exhibits or films. We had a limited amount of time and didn't get to check out any of the extras (IMAX film, planetarium, pirate exhibit). We saw almost all of the museum in 2 and half hours. We were there in the early afternoon on a weekday, and it seemed like most of the school groups had cleared out by then.

Among the areas within the store that I've visited in the past are boxing, basketball, hiking, shoes, workout clothing, swimming, & kayaking. They carry high-quality equipment from well-known brands. 

The store associates are helpful too without being too pushy. Specifically, they acknowledge your presense; ask you if they can be of assistance and then move along their way. The Sport Chalet also has a free membership rewards plan as well, which is nice to have, but not necessarily the selling point for shopping here. That is, you'd have to purchase a lot to accumulate a certificate for a few bucks off. Although, I probably receive a $10 off certificate at least twice a year just for being a member.

You're guided by the instructor as you first swim near the surface and then head deeper into the pool. I did feel really awkward at first, but that's to be expected.

The BF and I went here before seeing Louis CK for our anniversary. We were seated right away, so that was nice, but it was like 5:45 so that isn't too shocking. We sat outside, which was nice and had pretty christmas lights on all of the trees. The waiter comes by after about 5 minutes and asks us for drinks or apps and we ordered the burrata as an app. The menu said it was topped with a balsamic glaze, which sounded wonderful. We were also ready to order our pizza but the waiter disappeared immediately after taking our app order. So we wait. and wait. and wait. And I swear it felt like it was a half hour, but it was probably more like 10-15 minutes later (we were super hungry) the waiter came back to take our pizza order. We ordered the La Noce and he left. Well.... we waited some more. Finally got our burrata and it was a mess. Two giant globs of cheese with the lightest drizzle of balsamic dressing (not vinegar, because there is no way this weak stuff was straight up vinegar) surrounded by bread and prosciutto. It was large, so I'll give them that.... but too large in my opinion, because there isn't enough bread for the toppings. The burrata was good, creamy.... but it didn't taste like balsamic at all, which was the most appealing part of the app. The prosciutto was alright... it didn't have a ton of flavor, but it was fine. The bread had a burnt flavor... not my fave. Then we wait about 20 minutes.... waiter did not check on us.... Finally get the pizza. The pizza was good. That was the redeeming item of the night. It had arugula, walnut, ricotta, and mozz. It was a tasty combination.

 Now, the whole time we were there, there was a table of about 6-8 extremely loud, drunk, possibly old sorority girls sitting near us. All we could hear is their conversation, so much so, that we knew one girl was named rochelle and one was Tina and one had been divorced for 4 years and they had a friend named Lori who was just sooo crazy among many other details that we should not have gathered from sitting in their proximity, which obviously puts a damper on the experience. The waiter was so occupied with them, that we felt forgotten about all night. He was not attentive, he did not ask how things were, and he disappeared for long periods of time to go do who knows what for this other table (they had a bunch of ridiculous requests like splitting the bill 6-8 ways when the menu says they don't do that... hmmm). We sat down at 5:45 and barely got out of there around 7 to make it to our show (we were walking).

I didn't realize that ALL the Embassy suites do the Manager's happy hour in the evenings; this one was 5:30 - 7:30...But let me back it up a bit. My whole experience here was wonderful.

A nice man, Terry, drove the shuttle from the airport and was very helpful giving me some ""things to do ideas"" around the area - movie theatre, shopping mall...etc. When we pulled up to the front he even pointed out a restaurant next door, 7-11 and CVS. I was super tired from my flight so it was nice that he took the time to point things out since I was not paying attention.

I went inside and checked in- very fast and smooth. The FD clerk even offered me a beverage- hot coffee/tea/cocoa.  She even told me how to access the internet free of charge.  I found my room quite quick and going inside was so refreshing!

I had an immense amount of space for just me, as these acommodations are suites. The little kitchenette was stocked with tea and coffee and ice machine was just around the corner, not too far of a walk.  It was extremely chilly in the room so after I found the thermostat, I turned it to be warmer- I ended up turning it off I was so cold.  I did a quick flip through of TV channels but didn't find anything I wanted to watch. And then I tried to connect to internet- fast and easy.  I called to see about getting a bathrobe and some toothpaste and it was brought up in less than 10 minutes!

I thought about going sightseeing and ended up taking a nap. I didn't realize how tired I was!  The bed was great! Comfy and warm!  I didn't want to get up!  But I ended up getting up so I could go to CVS across the street for a few needed items.

Next morning when I left, there was nothing I needed to do to check out and the shuttle service back to the airport was very prompt. 

I wouldn't mind staying here again should I be stopping through town or stuck overnight on an unforseen layover!

Their Cob salad was also very good, nothing fancy but a good balance of veggies, bacon, egg, tomato, blue cheese, avocado with grilled chicken.

The club is usually pretty busy on a Saturday night, but the crowd leaves a bit to be desired.  The patrons are mostly unattractive, kind of trashy in fact, and not very friendly.  

I believe deejay in the main room does not change on the weekends, where he spins top 40 dance/pop to a drunk college-aged crowd.  In the OZ room (the smaller room) they have different local deejays, who, from what I've seen, spin a variety of different types of music--sometimes it's circuity music, sometimes it's eighties music, it all depends on the deejay for that night.  The OZ room has been pretty empty the few times I've been there.  The sound system in both rooms leaves quite a bit to be desired from a place that calls itself a club.  

The drinks are reasonably priced for a bar in Scottsdale.   The décor is okay, but not very interesting.  Forbidden isn't terrible.  It is, however, just plain boring (bad music on a bad sound system, uninteresting décor, and an unimpressive and unfriendly crowd)!",1,3,3,-3,"Negative","1"

This restaurant can be summed up in two words: mediocre & overpriced. I wish I had gone with my instinct and given more weight to the negative reviews. The positive reviews of the spring rolls lured me in, however, much to my disappointment. One spring roll is $4.50, although we fortunately went for the happy hour and only paid $3.50, which was still too much, in my opinion. They were stuffed mostly with lettuce and had little to no flavor., and we tried 3 different kinds. The peanut sauce was overly thick and cloyingly sweet and added nothing positive to the rolls.

I had the Lemon Grass Chicken for dinner. The chicken was overcooked and dry and absolutely flavorless and the noodles were overly sweet. I couldn't detect even a hint of the lemon grass. The presentation was unappetizing, with the overcooked chicken just slapped on to the side of the noodles.

I'm not going to speak for my companions as they were there at my invitation and probably didn't want to be negative, but neither of them made any positive comments about their food.

Aside from that, everything is average at best. As mentioned by others, this is Americanized Mexican cuisine. This is not autentica comida Mexicana, mi amigos!

We had been once before and thoroughly enjoyed the food. Hence making it a point to visit again on our most recent trip to Arizona.

We started with the chips and salsa set for the table - delicious. I ordered a bunch of queso for the table, and I started with a Tortilla Soup. It was hilariously underwhelming. I made the joke that it was kitchen scraps, and it looked the part. It was light tomato broth with a bunch of vegetables, a gob of cheese and a small corn on the cob on top. Yes, a small corn on the cob is on top. It was lousy and I wouldn't recommend it.

We ordered a pound of chicken fajitas and a half pound of vegetable ones (thanks to the vegetarian fiancee). It went surprisingly far for five of us... but the veggies weren't grilled much, which is sad because they were otherwise delicious. Also, the chicken fajitas only had one piece of green pepper and one of red on top. It should be lush with peppers and onions that have been grilled or possibly even caramelized (the onions).

Daniel E. wrote in his review the same concern, that there should be ""more than a pile of onions,"" that he expected at least some green, red or yellow peppers. The fajitas were good and quite filling. The accompaniments were decent - cheese, lettuce, sour cream and the like. Nothing fancy, certainly no frills.

So much potential, but it fails on almost everything. It's a true shame. This place needs to be on Restaurant Impossible with Robert Irvine... badly...

This time around... the service was really lousy. And my fiancee found a bug deep down in her water. Very disappointing. The waitress first replied confirming what size bug it was, and then explained it and claimed that ""we're not dirty, it's just the food smell."" Then she apologized and walked away. We think she deducted a soda from the final bill... but nothing else. A bug!

Culinary Dropout is guilty of succumbing to these two trends.  That being said, the service and atmosphere make it forgivable.  Our server and the manager were hyper aware of how long we'd been waiting.  Even though it was not that big of a deal to us, it was nice to know they cared.

They mean well when it comes to cocktails, but they were a little lightweight for me, relying heavily on simple syrup and mixers to dumb down the alcohol.  Their beer list made up for it, though.  I've never had a stout in a can, but they managed to find the brewery that pulled it off.

The automatic wash at this place is great and touch-less! I used to have to get out of my car and remove the antenna, so it wouldn't be sucked into those heavy foam sheets that touch car washes use. I never understood the point of those, but as a kid, was frightened by them. It was like your car was being engulfed and swallowed, I felt like Captain Ahab, in the belly of the white wale.   With this touch-less wash, no need to worry about antennas, mirrors, or anything else protruding from your car, or feeling like a character from classic literature. 

The prices are meh for what you get, just spend the extra 2 $ and get the 8$ wash. It gets your car super clean, and has a full dry at the end. 6$ bucks gets you no dry, and 7$ gets you a mediocre wash, that will make you say ""did I get my car washed at all?"" With the 8$ you get this special Green Foam spray stuff, and extra rinse and polish deal. This place would be 4 stars if they wash options were better, but overall it's not a bad place to get your car clean. They have vacuums and vending machines that disperse air fresheners, towels, and small bottles of armor-all...in case you are too lazy to go to AutoZone (which I am sometimes)

Clang...Clang.... like a slot machine in Vegas the change drops from the machine, as he reaches down he realized he just bought 10$ worth of wash tokens!  DOH!!!!

Anyway, we had a nice booth, but it was directly across from the pizza oven, so we were quite warm. Pleasant server, good busser/foodrunner keeping our waters filled. We decide to try the Bruschetta for a starter and the Rib-eye dinner for two for $28...an unbelievable price. The Bruschetta was quite good (and at $6 also a good value) and with a nice mozzerella and balsamic drizzle...it was tasty. The Rib-eye's on the other had, were not so nice. But, I must stress, these meals were $14 each...what did I expect? The steaks were large and tough; my husband said his tasted old. Yikes. Mine wasn't that bad, and the potatoes and veggies were flavorful. Our thoughts, under the premise of ""if we were running this restaurant"", are: we would have offered a much smaller but higher quality piece of steak. Food for thought, Javino's.

We stopped into Chompie's this past Friday morning on our way out of town for the long weekend. My husband and I have this obsession with breakfast bagels - in particular, breakfast bagels from one amazing joint that makes the absolute best breakfast bagel EVER in our college's hometown. We are always searching for a place as good as Bodo's...well, even 3/4 as good as Bodo's would do...and we never find it. Bodo's is about the most efficient bagel store on Earth (literally the line of 40-50 people is serviced in 10 minutes) and cheap, too!

So, we decided to give Chompie's a whirl. I don't love the location - like everything else in Arizona, it is tucked into a strip mall. However, there was enough parking and we found it just fine. When you walk in, you're a bit confused as to where to go. Then you realize if you want to eat a full service sit down meal, head to the left - we didn't want to do this, but the food that I was eyeing from afar looked good. To the right is their bakery, which has some pretty appetizing cakes, cookies and desserts. Then there is this counter where you deduce that you order ""to go"" meals. We were overwhelmed by the menu but managed to pull ourselves together in time to order. We both had that initial panic attack of ""oh crap, I have never been here and the menu is longer than a 5 year old's Christmas list and I don't even know where to start because suddenly I feel like I can't even read English."" Deep breath. It's not actually that overwhelming, just a tad unorganized. After ordering, we were instructed to walk all the way across the bakery to a random counter to pay. It was so random the way they had it set up, but we did as we were told and then we waited.

My husband's sandwich took a while to make....again, I don't know how Bodo's does it, but Chompie's is probably 4 times slower. Or is it more appropriate to say that Bodo's is 4 times as fast? Whatever. Either way, Bodo's has the breakfast bagel process down perfectly. Waiting was fine, though...we weren't in a rush. When my husband's warm sandwich was finally ready, we got our stuff and then headed outside (there is nowhere to eat inside if you don't want to have a full service meal, which is one complaint I would make about this place). Who wants to eat their bagel outside when it's pushing 110 degrees? Not me. Even if I am under a strip mall canopy that provides some shade.

Anyway, his sandwich was actually really tasty - warm and fresh and really yummy. My bagel was not toasted, which I had requested, which was slightly annoying. However, the bagel itself was very good. We will definitely be back for the food, and I totally recommend this place for grabbing some freshly baked bagels or desserts or whatever. They do have a deli counter as well (meats, cheese, etc). Our breakfast was less than $8 without drinks - fair enough.

I just wish that the layout were a little better and that it was more efficient. I also wish I could have eaten inside. Next time we will likely just do the full service thing.

-It didn't *feel* like a restaurant, it almost felt like a business that had turned into a restaurant.

-The take-out menu/brochure was worded pretty peculiarly in places.

-This one's hard to explain, but I sort of sensed some very subtle yet unsettling religious undertones throughout the whole experience.

We were there on opening night and fell in love with the decor.  The place was stylish and cool.  Concrete, leather, glass...very retro-modern.  The people who refurbished and redesigned this place deserve five stars.

The people who work there, however, deserve one.  

On opening night, I forgave the delay in service.  I forgave the nasty arugula on my panino.  I forgave the store-bought peperoni.  Mostly, I forgave them because the onion straws were so good.

We went back a few nights later after being fleeced for $40 in return for table scraps at Sens.  It took almost twenty minutes to order two pizzas and onion straws.  Then, the pizzas came out before the onion straws.  How do you cook pizza faster than deep frying an onion?  The waiter lingered around the female members of our party and were just incompetent.  

We finally went again after a night of drinking at the Clarendon.  What a buzz kill.  Not only was it too dark and the music was too loud but, again, the service was slow and dull.  Then, the waitress got into an argument about the ingredients of the pizza with our group.  Big no-no.

I've had multiple people tell me that service is fine as long as you order from the bar.  They say, just get up and go tell the bar tender what you want.  Why should I have to do all of the work?  How is it that they have ASU students at their disposal in a terrible economy and can't hire any decent waiters?

This happened to me recently -- but, instead of the boots, I found an unopened package of Spanx (marked down from $36 to $7.97), olive-colored DKNY tights for $.97, and a pair of Hunter knee-high boot socks for $4.97 (for when I eventually do find the rain boots).  I wasn't really looking for any of these finds, but couldn't resist.

Really good burger.

The Bad:
Terrible paint and lighting. Can't even hang out for long. (Maybe that is the idea.) Don't like high booth stalls much.
JMHO of course.
Also a note to the sewage smell that others noted. That little area on that side of the mall has smelled like hell for years for some odd reason. It sucks for the businesses, but I assure you it has nothing to do with Smashburger alone nor should it cause any health concerns. Just luck of the draw on a bad sewer vent problem.

Hope Kee has some of the very best Chinese food in town, in my opinion, and is worth the trip from wherever it is in the valley that you live.

Everything that they make is delicious, and sitting in there listening to the customers and staff talk in Chinese and Cantonese can really take you back to China, if you've had the pleasure of spending time there. Otherwise it's just about as close as you can get. 

If you want to eat some real Chinese food that is both delicious and approachable, and very reasonably priced, you can't beat Hope Kee. 

Get some soup or some congee, some clams with black bean sauce, some greens and some BBQ, and you'll see why China and Hope Kee are such hard places to stay away from.

In the interest of supporting local AZ businesses, my husband and I had dinner here on my b-day (5/13). The first thing I observed is that they have a couple walk-up windows on the southside of the building so you can place your order and get food without having to go inside. Thought that was pretty clever! We arrived close to 8 pm and it was still pretty busy inside, but the line moved quickly. 

The restaurant is set up cafeteria style with a kitschy country look. There is a huge mural on one wall dedicated to farm living and a John Deere tractor with accompanying bric-a-brac on the other side. Once we got through the line, I choose the meat plate with 2 sides...beef brisket and pulled pork for my meats, mac 'n' cheese and beans for my sides. I really wanted to get chicken instead of the pork, but they had unfortunately run out of chicken :( . My hubby got the full slab of pork ribs with sweet cut corn and mac 'n' cheese for his sides. We shared a piece of cornbread and for dessert, split the root beer cake. Happily I received a discount on my meal because it was my birthday (they advertise a ""free"" meal, though it's basically $10 off).

The beef brisket and pulled pork were so good! Tender, juicy, and delicious! Those meats really are the best reason to go Joe's. The beans and mac 'n' cheese were just ok...so far Fleming's beats everyone hands down when it comes to mac 'n' cheese! The cornbread was so-so, tasted like it came from a box, but the honey butter that comes with it made it pretty tasty. Regrettably, my husband's pork ribs were pretty fatty as compared to Lucille's (Tempe Marketplace). The root beer cake was good, but not as delectable as we thought it would be. Maybe we were expecting too much after reading how much fellow Yelpers enjoyed it? Another thing worth mentioning (some others have commented on it too) is how strange the beverage station is. It's smack dab at the front of the line where you get your food so you have to fight your way through the crowd (if there is one) to get a refill. Weird.

I know....a busy Saturday night and so, perhaps I should give both the servers and chef a break? Sorry. The menu has changed and so has the quality of food - and not in a good way. Let me just give you a brief sample of our experience - the Ahi Tuna Tartare appetizer has been changed to a lackluster combination of flavors. The idea of tuna with mango seems lovely however there is a total and complete blandness to the way this dish is now served. The former tuna appetizer was far more tempting. Moving onto the Goat Cheese Medallion Arugula salad. My salad was served sans medallion and literally laden with a huge glob of cold goat cheese and some terribly prepared mushrooms. What happened to the warm, crusted goat cheese? Next, we both ordered the Parmesan Crusted Sole. While the sole was prepared well, I do not recall this dish having a cream based sauce in the past. If memory serves me well, the dish should have had a lemon sauce delicately balancing the flavor of the fish. Cream and sole do not make a happy pair!  I am not sure if this was an error or part of the new menu. Okay, and for the piece de resistance we ordered a side of the Sugar Snap Peas which were actually drowning in a bath of some kind of soy and oil sauce. It actually made me ill to eat it - and my companion, as well.

I ordered the Southwestern Country Fried Steak, huge plate of food that came with your choice of House Salad or Ceaser Salad. I dove into the mashed potatos, which upon their many options of how you want your potatos to taste (garlic, cheese, horshradish, etc), I picked garlic - always go safe at a first time resturaunt! The gravy was very bland, I ended up putting more salt on it. The potatos were the only thing salty and flavored on my plate. They had also put diced garlic in the mix, not roasted, but raw garlic. I love garlic, but I can't eat whole cloves (horrible headaches) like some of those awesome people can out there, so it was kinda a downer there. The two pieces of country fried steak was actually steak, but the very fatty piece of steak that you should never buy, cook, and serve.

Since I came with friends and family, it seemed the only thing they could put flavor in was the deep fried dishes. My mother ordered the Fish and Chips, they were slightly on the dark side, the fish wasn't fishy but slightly bland, the cocktail sauce was the only thing that saved the fish from being totally neglected lol. The fries were really good though! My friend had ordered the same thing, I think she wasn't complaining was because she had ordered mamosa's lol.

Service-wise, it was slow, but don't expect to be waited on asap on a dead Monday.

I think the only thing that tasted good was the Ice Cream Fudge Brownie, but that single dish alone won't help this review get to two stars.

Taps looks like a sports bar when you enter. Only thing there appears to be only 2 TVs or at least where we were sitting I could only see two both above the bar. The decor is appealing, fresh, lots of light coming in from outside. 
We were seated and very soon offered drinks. When the drinks came to the table we had both decided on their special.  Soup and Salad. With this you get a tomato soup, as much as you want and a choice of several salads again as much as you want. 
Not sure why but lately I have had a hard time getting soup that is hot. The soup came out at somewhere well below the state required 130 degrees. We sent it back asking to warm it up. We got it back it was warmer but still not hot. My wife's salad came out with her soup my salad came out a little later. I got the wedge. My soup and salad was very good. My wife also liked her meal. So the food gets a 4.
The service was very slow. It took over 15 min to get the first of our meal to the table. I did order a second different salad as well as did my wife. This also took about 15 min to bring to the table. For what was going to be a quick lunch we were there about an hour. There was only 5 other tables in the place with people at them so the reason for being slow was not that it was crowded. 
The plates bowles they used to serve the food in is extremely small. By the time you had eaten you salad it was all over the table. It is impossible to keep in the small bowel it is served in. If you put the same amount of feed in a larger bowel it would be much better.

They can't find my house. It's not hard to find, I swear. It's a piece of cake, and a stone's throw from a major crossroad. They had once taken two hours to deliver a pizza, saying they tried to call me (they didn't), only to return to the store and bring it back once I called. Naturally, I was delivered a lukewarm pizza, but in the nicest way possible was told that it was *my* mistake.  Unacceptable, in the age of online ordering and GPS systems in our phones, there is no excuse for getting lost in what is essentially a three mile drive in a straight line. 

Without complaining, I had received a coupon for a free large pizza. Apology accepted. Upon visiting the store, I got to keep the card *after* ordering because they gave me the wrong toppings. Suckers.

Also, they always take longer than the ETA, even in the middle of a weekday. Even now, I am waiting 70 minutes for a 30-40 minute order, and when I had called 15 minutes ago, was told it was on its way, but that construction was holding it up. Yes, there is construction, but you have taken this long in the past without it. Also, construction would not explain why it takes nearly an hour to produce one large pizza. I even tip nicely.

Sometimes, if I'm really hungry, I order it with a side of their twice baked casserole (twice baked potato in a cup, basically. It's unbelievable.) I'd also recommend the Arizona caviar (black bean salad) or southwest coleslaw.

My dad loves their BBQ sandwiches (with choice of homemade barbecue sauce - each one better than the last), my mom usually orders one of their other great salads with a side of potato pancakes (better than grandma's), and grandpa loves whatever is on special. Even my picky-eater brother loves food at Open Range - and that's saying something!

Bethany and Tom are the owners; Bethany does most of the kitchen cooking and Tom says that he's in charge of most of the barbecuein'. (He once gave my family a taste of some of their freshly smoked pecans and WHOA, they were GOOD.) The restaurant (as the name suggests) has a full service deli too, in case you need a pound of freshly sliced ham as well as a meal.

In the past, the service has been slow, but it has improved dramatically over the past year. The restaurant has a killer view of the Superstition Mountains, and is within 10 - 20 minutes of countless hiking trails. 

To make this long review short: if you're looking for a tastes-like-home (or tastes-better-than-home) cooked meal and you're in the far east valley, make sure to stop in for lunch or dinner. You'll probably see my family and me chowing down too.",1,3,0,4,"Positive","5"

I lucked out when I booked an appointment and by luck of the draw wound up being styled by Maira. She's great at what she does, sweet as can be, and always remembers little details of my life that even I forgot I told her!

I really like that they don't even try to push product on you, unlike many other salons, and they give you a mini-massage before your shampoo.

I took a star away because of a bad experience I had with one of their aestheticians about 2 years ago. She put Retinol on my eyelids, which is a no-no. Lots of itching and pain for a few days afterwards. She also made like she was giving me a product for free, but wound up charging me for it. Like I said, that was 2 years ago and I don't think that aesthetician is still working there, but I haven't gone in for anything other than a haircut since.

What attracted me to this place was the separate vegan menu in addition to their regular menu - this makes things easier when dining with vegan and non-vegan friends.  So I happily ordered a tofu wrap and added fried potatoes as a side and awaited my food.  We started eating and my friend found a hair in his food...not good!  He threw it on the floor and tried to drop it.  Well moments later I found a hair in my food...  I couldn't believe there was hair on both of our plates!  I was so disgusted I could no longer eat my food (and I was ravenous).  I told the girl working the register about the whole ordeal, she walked back to the kitchen then back to the register and completely ignored me (she said she'd come back to my table).  Before we left I spoke with someone else and showed them the hair, clearly not one of mine.  All I got was ""Oh, I'll check the guys in the back.""  Check the guys in the back???  What?  How about, sorry may I refund you your money?  Additionally, the few bites I had of my burrito were pretty bland, it needed seasoning or hot sauce.  Overall, I wouldn't go back...unless I somehow develop a taste for hair, although I'm sure that won't happen.

They get one star for having decent service and another star for having quite good portions.  

On the other hand, the food was crap, especially for the price I was paying.  I had steak fajitas, not normally the cheapest thing, but for something between $12-$15 I expected something tastier.  If they had been the most delicious thing ever, I wouldn't have cared but I didn't even take the half of the food I had left home.  The steak had a funny after taste and a lot of my onions were burnt.  The beans were mediocre and tortillas were average.

Service was in fine form-- I couldn't have the market-made maple syrup blend, nor any of the house-whipped cream, blueberry compote, raspberry and apricot jams, or any of the flavored syrups used at the coffee counter (my server patiently checked for those items we were unsure about), and when I asked for chocolate chips, I was, instead, offered a chocolate syrup made from scratch composed of chocolate, sugar, and coco oil... good stuff!  This syrup would be excellent on ice cream sundaes, too.  (FYI, I didn't really need anything extra to add to the pancakes and meatballs... the two paired well!)

I've mentioned this once before, but I think it's such a great thing to yelp about again-- buy an espresso (or any of their specialty coffees), and you can have unlimited cups of regular coffee during your meal!  Not like I needed more caffeine after the double-shot, but I did have some of the house-blend coffee.  After 1.5 pancakes, the meatballs (watch out, they're very greasy!), and caffeine, I'll be good to go for a few hours, despite only having four hours of sleep!  (I'm hoping, anyway!)

p.s.  Despite tipping more than 20% at the cashier upon ordering, I thought Bruce, the server who took care of me at my table, deserved a couple more bananas for not displaying annoyance at my staying here so long.  One more reason why I love Liberty Market so much!  

Addendum:  After getting directions from Bruce as to the quickest way to 101 N, he asked me if I wanted a cup of coffee to go, gratis!  Have I told you how much I love Liberty Market??

The presentation is very impressive.  It is served on ice with different kinds of salt and (to us) a very unique way of presenting the wasabi.

Grilled zucchini.... Very good and juicy.

Seabass with miso.  Cooked perfectly.

I think this is the next frontier for marketing gurus; a potential fortune could be made here. Most restaurants fall into the category of being painfully bland (""China Food""), vaguely insulting ethnic caricatures (""Mr. Yings' Happy China Meal"") or horrific puns (""Pho Sure""). Names like these don't inspire a lot of confidence in the quality of their food, even though that's not always the case (for example, ""China Food"" was actually pretty good).

So when I saw Thai Elephant, my mind immediately reversed the name which sounds suspiciously close to a parasitic disease (elephantiasis). Plus the fact that it's located in a strip mall is a bit of a red flag. But a growling stomach can overcome these biases and so I pulled into the lot......

......And was pleasantly surprised. This is actually pretty good Thai food. The inside is a little more ornate than you would have expected; there's the whitewashed walls that fits the strip mall theme, but the furniture is darker wood with slightly dimmed background lighting. A large screen TV was playing the Suns game in the back room and a small bar is present in the front part of the restaurant. There are a few tables as well as some seats with a mix of wooden booths and chairs.

Still wary, I ordered the hot tea, Thai sweet potatoes and chicken Pad Thai. All of these were above average: the Thai sweet potatoes were perfectly fried and mixed well with the slightly tangy sauce. I may have eaten more than ten times my body weight in Chicken Pad Thai over the years, and this was definitely above average. 

Although I was just here for dinner, I did see that they have a Happy Hour which runs from 5-7 pm. 

All in all, it's a pleasant place that belies its' strip mall exterior and is worth a visit for respectable Thai food.",2,3,2,4.5,"Positive","4"

I guess there is a whole slew of stuff we missed seeing, and some other exhibits we passed were closed for a wedding.  I guess it's cool to get married in the orangutan exhibit.  Or else the orangutans were getting married.  (Maybe those anti-gay marriage folks were right in that it would lead to animal marriages??!)

Anyways, we all know it's not the greatest of zoos because it's freaking hot half the year and it's not super nice to subject a lot of animals to 115 degrees.  But it's a decent enough selection, they have friendly staff, it's clean, and they have free parking. GD I love me some free parking.

Lots of the ""learn more by pressing this button"" things didn't work.  At least one water fountain didn't work (but hey- it was conveniently next to an overpriced soda machine!).  Like most other zoos they make you exit through the gift shop, so your wee ones can spend the car ride home crying about how they didn't get x overpriced toy/stuffed animal.

I do think if your kids are young enough, you could probably just take them past the ticket counter and check out the animals you can see below the bridge/in the water.

Just like the menu says, their Pad Thai has a plethora of intense flavors, to the point where every bite is unique.  If you love Pad Thai and haven't tried Wild Thaiger's, you need to.  If you don't love Pad Thai, it's probably because you haven't tried Wild Thaiger's.  :)  Seriously, this is one of the best dishes I've found in Phoenix.

Their other dishes are consistently good as well.  I love Chicken Satay, but most places only offer it as an appetizer, with a few skimpy chicken strips.  Wild Thaiger, on the other hand, has a filling Peanut Chicken lunch, as well as a Peanut Passion dinner, both drenched in their delicious peanut sauce.  Their curries are very flavorful and make for a superb and hearty dinner, but if you're going for lunch, you may want to consider Thai Basil up the road as their curry lunch combo includes a salad and other extras.

Their Thai Tea is strong yet creamy, just like it should be, and you can even add boba to it.  A must if you're eating anything spicy.

The service is very professional and timely.  The atmosphere is pretty classy, in fact, it's probably the nicest-looking Thai restaurant I've been to.  It's also the only Thai restaurant I can think of with a patio.  All in all, it has a very welcoming atmosphere.  I would feel just as comfortable here in a suit as I would a T-shirt and jeans.  It's a great place for dates, business lunches, or just some great take-out.  You might spend a tad bit more here than at some other nearby joints, but the quality more than makes up for it, I would say the prices are spot-on.

If you're looking for food, then you may be disappointed in the small amount of options, however, when you realize that their kitchen is the size of a small closet, it kind of makes sense.

Yelped it the moment I passed by it because of all the cars present in their parking lot. Although there are only 8 reviews for the place, what people had to say about it really made me want to visit. 

Was well greeted on a spontaneous adventure to the restaurant for dinner. The bar was packed so my party decided to get seated in the main dining area. Got seated right away and was introduced to our server in no time. Think she had to swallow a chill pill or something because it took some time for her to be nice (most likely the main reason im not giving this place 5 stars)

The menu was pretty reasonable. Starters dont exceed $10 and entrees range anywhere from $5-$15 (If Im correct, there is only one item on the menu costing $15) 

We started off with three appetizers, thinking it would be the only dishes ordered (little did we know):

- Grilled Spicy Chicken Wings: Some a little burnt but it tasted great. The portions are large and seasoning just right (or too bland depending on what you prefer). I liked that it was grilled, less of that greasy hell overwhelming the taste of the actual meat.

- Homemade lemon garlic Hummus with pita : sooo delicious. It was only about $6, it comes with a bunch of pita. My party of 4 shared it and still had left overs =] definitely recommended.

- Cheeseburger Sliders x3 on Egg Bun: The bun is delicious! and the meat is perfectly cooked (medium) and seasoned. The perfect balance of meat, bun, and cheese. Comes with diced pickles.

We were having a jolly time when all of a sudden someone notices a dish being served to the the table next to us. It looked so good, she decided to order it herself. We ended up sharing the Half Chicken entree and I was extremely impressed with how it came out.

The chicken is juicy and tender the entire way through. No parts of the chicken dry, every bite was well savored and just...mmm mmm mm
Came with two sides (we chose the green beans/onions and mashed potatoes): green beans weren't my favorite, they were overcooked but the mashed potatoes. Perfectly cooked, tasted so fresh. They don't use a ton of butter or sour cream which was favorable to my taste buds. 

Would definitely come again

FYI:

Fearing it was something like a ""Waffle House"" which I'd had the misfortune to visit once at 3am, I was prepared to turn and walk out if it was disgusting.

The front entrance is lined with rocking chairs and this location has water misters out there, which is good because the only place I have been that is hotter than Buckeye is Needles, Ca and i think Needles, Ca is right underneath a hole in the Ozone!

Anyway, inside they have a little country store with every kind of candy you can imagine and seasonal cute stuff along with books, toys, gifts and such.

First of all, they have an extensive wine list, which includes a rare type of sparkling wine, called Brachetto. In this area, DUI's are more common than a cold, and it's a light and tasty wine, with a low alcohol content. So it's option is great for me. It also goes great with everything they serve, because of it's unique flavor profile.

Lizzie was our waitress, and offered options and suggestions, which actually saved us quite a bit of money on the whole. Not that, by any stretch of the imagination, is this a place to go when you are not intending a big splurge. This is a place to take it slow and spend slightly over a decent amount. 

The food, however, is absolutely worth it. We tried the Cheddar fondue, which could have used a bit more mustard powder and worstershire sauce, but on the whole was delicious. It was well prepped, and Lizzie explained what she was adding and why the whole time. The veggie selection is a bit mundane, and that's really my only complaint. We ate the ""big night out"" prix fix menu and chose the ""Fusion"" option which had lobster tail, shrimp, brats, ravioli, new york strip, sirloin steak, and a marinated chicken. We cooked it in the Boullion method which is just a flavored broth. Because it's not oil, you do need to add 30 sec to a min to the suggested cook times, but it was a lot lighter than using the oil and we didn't come home smelling like oil. The california salad was incredible. It had mixed greens, sliced roma tomatoes, chopped pecans, and blue cheese crumbles with a rasberry black walnut dressing. It's been a long time since I was able to truly enjoy a salad, and this was amazing. The chocolate we chose was the Smore. It was milk chocolate, marshmallow creme flambeed with grahm cracker bits added after the fire goes out. It's served with 2 types of coated marshmallows, pound cake, a slice of cheese cake, and a bowl of sliced strawberries and bananas. Just enough to fill us up, but we didn't overstuff ourselves.

You do have the option of sitting at the bar and having just a cheese or chocolate, if you are on a time constraint though.

For me, it felt a little big, commercial, the decor was kinda cheesy - think red leather chairs, Pier1 Important wall sconces, even a ""VIP"" looking lounge in red velour. Hardly, original or intimiate enough to be considered an authentic ""wine bar"" in my opinion. If you're a regular at chain restaurants you'll probably think this is a cute place (call me a snob, whatever). Let's talk about the wine list at this ""wine bar"" --- it was okay but they were out of our first two choices of red - not ideal for a wine bar. Then, we ordered our bruchetta for our table of four and were annoyed when it came out cut in halves. Knowing we were sharing the plate, maybe the waitress should have clued us in? We ended up ordering a second board for the table so we could each try the variety. I do have to say, the bruchetta was good. 

We were clearly there for happy hour on a Wednesday night (which I do love goes until 6:30pm) but found it a little rude that the waitress came by six minutes after the mark to ask if we wanted a second round. There was no grace period so we paid full price. We did notice, that our full price glasses of wine were filled to the brim - so maybe 1/2 price = have the wine? 

Don't get me wrong... the place is cute enough, would def seem like a ""fancy date night place"" if I were still in college. I'd go again with girlfriends but won't be racing back with my husband.

The food is even better. I have never ordered anything I didn't love (with the exception of the cheesecake, which isn't made in-house - it was just okay). I crave their tuna salad on a regular basis - it's good both in the tuna salad salad and in the tuna salad sandwich.  The grilled cheese is the bomb, and so is the cashew butter banana sandwich. The mac and cheese is superb, as well. Seriously, everything rocks. I highly recommend ordering the mixed greens as your side if you get a sandwich - the dressing is light and citrusy and smacks of homemade excellence.

My boyfriend's favorite food is BBQ-anything so I left the ordering up to him (and the choice was easy): Whole Hog Heaven - 4 meat choices plus 3 sides. Settling on St. Louis and Baby Back Ribs, BBQ Chicken, and Brisket, with sides of mac & cheese, coleslaw, and beans - he was as giddy as a kid on Christmas. I was pretty hungry too - and I had to admit the smell of BBQ wafting through the back kitchen door had my taste buds excited. The meal did not disappoint to say the least. The ribs were literally falling off the bone, the chicken was cooked perfectly, and the brisket was melt-in-your-mouth tender. All 3 sides were the perfect addition, however I do have to say that the coleslaw was my favorite, especially paired with the brisket. 
What sent us over the edge of BBQ heaven were the extra special additions before and after the meal. To start us off - homemade, warm cornbread with whipped butter. To finish us off - complimentary mini donuts (yes, you heard me right).

"4830","WG12ZAP1dSPVHw45TMiukg","3","This was really 3.5 stars and I'm rounding down to 3 for a few reasons...on which I will now elaborate.

District could be in any Sheraton, anywhere.  In fact, it is strikingly similar to Rum Fire, the trendy restaurant in the Sheraton Waikiki where I stayed for a few days this summer before my family arrived and we stayed moved to the family place.  The flooring, the red circular lounge area, the live music on Thursday nights...it was all the same.  Heck, even the menu was the same.  The difference was that in Waikiki there was a ""Hawaiian"" slant to everything and the live music was much, much better.  (And of course the beach front setting).  I get the impression that they are trying to market themselves as a ""downtown restaurant"" more than the ""place in the Sheraton""...but to be honest, it is your quintessential trendy hotel restaurant.

The bartenders were really friendly.  The wine list for a ""wine bar"" is incredibly lacking.  Nothing interesting, nothing fun.  The pricing is on par with what I would expect from a hotel.  The space is modern and trendy, something that there isn't that much of in downtown.  I love the charm of a historic home, but I also love sleek and modern lines.

We selected a few small plates, or appetizers, depending on which of their menus you are looking at.  The crab cakes were good, if nothing short of predictable, and the chips and dip were surprisingly unique.  A dill dip and a French onion dip provided a nice departure from the regular spinach artichoke.  I'm not sure this is a place that I would come to for dinner, and it is definitely not a place I would come to for brunch.  (The brunch menu is a typical hotel menu, with typical hotel pricing).  I think that for me District will just remain a place for drinks and small bites.  

I'm not going to lose my mind over this place.  It's not that great, I'd say it's fairly generic.  But the staff was friendly and it's within walking distance of my place.  I'm sure I will be back for drinks.",8,12,4,9,"Positive","4"

"4840","odRs5g6bEmHacVc9jLZymg","1","Great food can be found anywhere. Great service is one in a million these days. This place gets an A+ in the most awful service I have ever received and if you have/had a Groupon for this place like I did, don't even bother going. You'll be treated worse than a bothersome fly on a hot and humid day.

It's simple. Businesses put  their name out by working with daily coupon sites like Groupon, LivingSocial, etc., to garner new and potential repeat customers. Instead, after going there with my handy coupon, I can't help but drive by this place on the way home and think nothing but the horrible experience I received. 

I went with my boyfriend and bought the Groupon because I was impressed due to online reviews and decided to splurge on a good ole' prime rib. We sit down, am impressed with the old school decor, and then the server from Azkaban appears. We tell her that we'd like to order off the special evening menu where it's a little cheaper and tell her joyfully that we found this place through Groupon and that it's our first time. Wrong thing to do. I don't know if it's because past Groupon-ers don't tip well or something, but I could swear her smile immediately turned 180 degrees in an instant. 

It took our food (the chicken and prime rib) almost 33 minutes to come out. All we did was nom ... and nom ... and nom on the watery coleslaw and gritty liver (which isn't to blame since I was never a liver fan). Not once did our server come by our table. We watched her run into the kitchen and either not come back out for a while or attend to other tables. It was another server that came out and gave us our food so we let our frustration go since it wasn't her fault and there's no use in calling her out for nothing. We asked if she knew where our server was, and she said she would look for her. 10 minutes later, nothing, yet it was the new server who kept coming back, asking if everything was alright like a normal server should. 

Then it was time for the check and we just wanted to get out of there since we were basically ignored. 17 minutes pass, no check came even though our  table had been cleared. Our server was still MIA so we asked a random server to give us our check. He said he would tell our server to bring it back and we told him straight up that we didn't even want to see her face so another random server brought it back.

We had a table of 4 sitting next to us who even leaned over and asked us why we were being so calm when our non-existent server was treating us like crap. We didn't even want to bother waiting another 20 minutes just to talk to a manager since apparently the only way the servers here communicate is by playing Telephone so we just left after paying. The table beside us told us that they were going to complain for us since we wanted to leave, but whether they did or not I didn't even care at that point. 

To be honest, I can't even remember what the food tasted like, which isn't quite fair in a review. I went here a couple of months ago, but I have never had an experience where service overrode the taste of food. I'm pretty sure prisoners in a cafeteria get more attention than I did.

We live in the same neighborhood and see the place all the time but the look of the place was never enough to draw us in.  There is nothing eye catching about the business front at all.  It's in a strip mall and looks old.  At night, they turn on strands of tacky Christmas lights that only attract attention to the fact that the lights are so poorly hung.

When we arrived for dinner we were greeted by an empty corridor, no host station and no host.  We could see what looked to be a bar but it wasn't a bar that I'd want to eat, drink and socialize at.  To pass the time until we were finally greeted we browsed the many framed publications touting how incredible the place was.  I'm already here...I don't need any more persuasion.  It's time for the Chef/owner to take down the ""look how good I was"" trophy wall and go with a more inviting modern look.

We were greeted by friendly gentleman who seated us on the main lower floor.  He handed us our menus and asked if he could get us something to drink.  There is no drink menu on the menu.  No beer list, no soda list, no liquid period.  We asked to see the wine list, which had only bottle prices and doesn't even hint that they sell wine by the glass.  Once I asked if they had beer and sold wine by the glass it was like we made a breakthrough.   The menu seems a bit outdated so I  went with the Lasagna, the basics.  While we sat waiting for our meal, the salads came.  Weird...the menu didn't mention anything about a salad nor did the waiter.   More lack of information from the menu.

Now on to the decor.  It is terribly outdated.  Tacky, bland, pale paint scheme, brass fixtures, mirrors and cliche wine bottles.  There were beautiful fresh flowers throughout which we really enjoyed.  I was unfortunately seated directly in front of two paintings both with a woman and a little girl drinking what appears to be wine.  I'm guessing they are personal family paintings but they are horribly out of place and bordering on creepy.  I couldn't take my eyes off of them and that distracted me throughout the night.  This place needs a makeover, new modern paint scheme and some updating on the artwork.

The lasagna came.  It was OK at best.  I tried my fiance's chicken genevese at it was horrible.  The chicken tasted like it was boiled which is an instant dish killer for me.  We did not take our leftovers.  We asked for the check and it came with a after dinner cordial which was a nice surprise and tasted delicious.

Picture a girl hanging with her lovely on a Monday afternoon after what could be politely described as a terrible week before, looking to soothe her spirit with some lovely food and atmosphere [the company was already delightful...]. I saw a piece in the local rag about C4 and since we're already in Moon Valley I say 'how 'bout it'. Jeff agrees and we're off - 

We arrived just before 4 - closing time and the bartender/waitperson was reeeeally nice. She told us we had only a few minutes to order because the kitchen would be closing and that the pizza oven was already off. No worries, we remain unfazed. We sat at a high top next to the bar, there were a few other people at tables nearby, some drinking coffee and one couple enjoying the bruschetta and some wine on a leather sofa by the large fireplace. The room hits just the right notes for me, warm and inviting, nice art but not overpowering - its a place I could hang out in. We both had a nice glass [generous pour] of a Voga Pinot Gris and a sandwich. I had smoked salmon, Jeff had roast beef.

I picked them because they have a great ""rewards program"" and because they have heavy presences in places where I travel often.

So this is a bad branch. There's a couple decent check-out kids, but in general their employees are among the worst trained I've ever seen, in terms of providing polite, timely, friendly customer service. They avoid your eyes when they see you looking for something in an aisle, lest you bother them with a question. They never EVER greet you with a smile and a ""good morning"" or a ""did you find everything you need?"" while you check out. They have inconsistent policies about whether or not coupons can be scanned from iPhone or paper copies needed (the manager basically called me a liar when I said checkout people have scanned my iPhone coupons many times in the past).

Tour de Tavern is a tribute to tipsy teamwork and a perfect way to host a unique group event. As ""pedalers"" on their inaugural tour, we enjoyed the celebrity treatment of cruising down the winding streets of Old Town Scottsdale as onlookers snapped photos and cheered us on!

We rocked out to top 40 hits and, by special request, our Lonely Island favorites on their awesome sound system. Our guides were flexible and let our party run the show. If we needed more time for let's say...... an impromptu horseback ride in front of Shotgun Betty's, they were more than happy to wait. 

As an added bonus everyone gets to burn off some of those unwanted cocktail calories in between your favorite watering holes. If you are concerned that after a few stops (and a few shots) your legs might lose some of that forward momentum, there are a few coveted ""non pedaling"" seats in the back of the bike. We all compromised with a friendly and fair rotation system. 

Our tour guides were helpful, accommodating, and entertaining. They even proved to be exceedingly patient upon discovering that we did in facts have ""that guy"" in our group. 

If you're saying to yourself,  ""Such a marvelous experience could only cost an arm and least the majority of a leg"" then you would be wrong! With the cost of gas being substituted for sheer earth friendly man power, our group of fifteen people spent less than $30 bucks each for the experience.

But wait, there's more! Included in this price are all the amazing special deals that Tour de Tavern exclusively brings you at select bars along the route. On our tour we were offered drinks specials ranging from $3 to ONE PENNY!  I say this in all caps because it's ONE PENNY!

So next time you are planning an event, I recommend Tour de Tavern 100%!

Service was prompt, and they had my reservation.  The Keg has gone out of their way to have hostesses who could double as the models on the Howie Mandel Deal or No Deal gameshow, so initially I figured confusion would ensue.  It didn't.  : )

Beer was served cold and quickly when ordered, so no delays on the service.

Their appetizer choices were mostly seafood which doesn't help me out.  We got some kind of bowl of cheese and ""stuff"" and a plate of chips to dip with.  It was ok, but not exceptional.  I hope they turn up the appetizer department to take care of non-seafood eaters.

Anyways, the Wedge salad I got was very good.  Drenched in a bit more Blue Cheese than I would have expected even for a Wedge salad, so if you are adverse to too much dressing, you may want to get the dressing on the side.  

The steak I ordered was supposedly bacon wrapped, but I could not taste it if it was.  It was a good filet though, and they did cook to my ordered temp on the first order.  Always nice to get it right the first time!

There were only 2 other tables in there and the windows were covered (no view) - it was weird so I immediately asked to be seated in the main part of the restaurant.

"5009","RmOyqOn1cM1f0neN-b3lHQ","4","I stopped by early this morning to satisfy my crave for something new. The place is very clean and a man came out to greet me and was ready to serve. He clearly explained every item I was curious about since the labels were in Spanish. I asked if his name was Miguel and he said yes. I told him I read about his bakery on Yelp. Then he said that he loves Yelp and that's how word is going around now for him and he also uses to find reviews on other places. He was very friendly and had lots of patience. I was the only customer at the time and he actually doesn't mind having a conversation unlike open ended talks with others. I ended up buying 10 pastries and it cost $6.80. What a great deal!


They also sell other items such as tamales, burritos, and menudo. I inquired about the burritos cuz I like mine with a little kick,but unfortunately they weren't ready yet. He showed me the homemade tortillas and he says he used them on the burritos. He said they don't look big, but he assured that the burritos are filled with red (mild) or green (with a kick) chili, shredded pork, and some potatoes. He said that one burrito is good to fill up a person. So...I must come back and try it. 


So far I've had the flaky pastry with the shredded coconut and Bavarian cream...the Bavarian wasn't as creamy than I'm used to. I almost thought it would have been better off to not have it, but it's a nice added flavor when you eat it all together rather than just tasting the Bavarian on its on. 


I had that curvy, pretty looking pastry which is topped with crystal sugars and with all the sugar on top, I thought it might be too sweet, but nope. It was just fine with the pineapple filling (excuse me as I wipe my drool). 


Then it was off to have the caramel flautas dusted with powdered sugar. The first bite was eh. The second bite was...um. Third bite, WOW!

We are from San Diego and have been trying to find Mexican food places similar to the food out in San Diego.  We pulled up to the location and were debating if we should go in or not.  The area wasn't the best, and it was in a tiny strip mall.  Kind of looked like a taco shop.  We decide to go in, because we were starving.  Inside it looked completely different.  It was a little dark and dated.  But the atmosphere was very causal and the hosts were super nice.  We sat down and right away got some nice warm chips, salsa and beans served to us.  I was feeling like a margarita and was going to get the house one, when the waitress said they had 99 cent margaritas available.  We ordered our food and didn't have to wait very long to get it.  Super good food and really cheap 99 cent margaritas. The margaritas were served in pretty nice size glasses but a bit strong.  FYI, I think you're getting really cheap alcohol in there, seemed pretty stiff. I started buzzing after my second glass.   My husband even loved the Chile reino that he tried from my plate.  He usually doesn't like it at all.  The carne asada was seasoned very well, it was a great change from some of the bland Mexican food I've had out here in phoenix. My husband had the beef chimichanga and it was seasoned really well also.  For the price you can't beat it.

* You claim New Mexican grub and then you charge for chips and salsa or sopapillas which are standard complements to any New Mexican restaurant meal.
* At $3, the coffee is  a rip off! Seriously? We're not talking cappuccino, people and you're selling build-your-own Bloody Marys for the same price!
* The carne adovada was tender but not very spicy.

That said:
* The green salsa was really good.
* I'm so desperate for carne adovada, I'll settle. (besides, $9 is more than a fair price for 3 eggs, black beans and carne adovada in a bowl on a flour tortilla - even if it was more beans than pork.)
* There are several options for $5; and, if they are all like the eggs benedict, they are generous portions.

I spend a decent amount of time at this Barnes & Noble and have 'used the facilities' a number of times as well.  At the very minimum, there's always toilet paper all over the floor and at least one or two un-flushed toilets - with 'number two.'  Really, people...  

Last night, in addition to the usual messiness, I kid you not  - there was an enormous cucumber sitting on the toilet paper holder in one of the stalls, and a padlock with two keys on the floor.  As I sat 'doing my business' I couldn't help but contemplate whether these objects were some sort of weird clues for a scavenger hunt, a murder mystery, or something equally disturbing.  (Needless to say, I got out of there as quickly as I could rather than looking around for more ""clues."")

Other than that, it's a typical Barnes & Noble complete with a Starbucks Cafe.  The book and media selection is solid; no complaints.

"5046","g8HTHavL-ovkkJ05XJaf0A","3","Michael C is right. This place is very charming. I love the inside decor, with brick walls. I love the ""No Sniveling"" sign hanging behind the bar.

It's a small place, but that's part of the appeal. There's a small upstairs patio, with a fireplace (wasn't on when I went) that could be a great spot to hang. It's not much of a view, but there's something cool about being at a higher elevation. 

Finding J. Chew was a little bit of a challenge. We ended up stopping at AZ88 to ask for directions. LOL! When we arrived, my friend and I sashayed up to the bar. Immediately we had a drink menu in front of us. I was more intrigued by the huge crystal ball-esque 20 Questions game. I wanted to play!

When I asked about beer, the 'tender motioned to the shelf above his head. Ahh... Not a great selection, but it'll do. I went with the Honey Brown. $4.50. Great price. Okay beer. I'll order something else next time, if I can make up my mind. Stella? Fat Tire? Hmm... 

The whole reason for venturing to J. Chew was for a celebration. My friend was getting married, and this was her final Saturday night as a ""single."" So, the group of women sat outside on the small patio area. It was a cold, chilly May evening and they had the fireplace going. They also had a couple heat lamps working, but most of them were out of propane. Bummer. We Phoenix Dwellers were shivering our coconuts off, if you know what I mean. (Praise Allah for fingerless gloves, which were a big hit that night.) But, the bartender did try and keep them going, so we appreciated his efforts!

Overall, I like J Chew. Yet I can't rate it higher than 3.5 for a few reasons. Yes, one is the beer selection. While it's small, it's also doable. Yet, their mixed martini list looked disgusting. Then again, I don't do martinis. Nor do I throw down $11 on a mixed drink. 

But the real annoyance came from other patrons. From one guy in a hockey jersey throwing himself against the glass door (even hitting his head on the glass, when prompted) to a crazy D'Backs fan yelling in the face of a calm Braves supporter, those couple of guys just totally zapped the cool, calm and collected from J. Chew & Co. There's something defeating and sad about seeing another man yell ""Lock it up!"" at another man, during what could be a calm, mature discussion about two sports teams they individually love and follow. There's something even sadder about watching an aging man with a cigar hit on a married woman. He just wouldn't leave our group alone. Oh well...Maybe they won't be there when I go back... because I think if they are, I'm gonna have to say something. How obnoxious. 

If you're in Old Town and looking for a chill spot to hang, this is your place. Plus, I liked the music they had on rotation... From Modest Mouse and Postal Service to 90's grunge and alternative rock, I was diggin' the tunes, along with the laid back atmosphere, the great service and the knowledge that there was a chill place in Snottsdale to hang. Who knew?! I just don't think there's a strong enough draw to hang at this place all night. This is more of your ""before dinner"" or ""before another bar"" type of estabilshment. Only problem is there's not many other cool places in the area I'd be interested in going, especially on a Saturday night when Snottsdale is out in full force.",1,4,0,6,"Positive","5"

At present, it leaves something to be desired, but we're starved for a place to shop on this side of town that has local and/or natural foods, so something is better than nothing! Also, I have faith that they will expand the available goods as time goes on. I'm excited to see how it develops.

The good:  Great bread! This is the best part of this place thus far. The breads are fresh daily, baked locally, CHEAP ($1.79 per loaf for white, wheat, rye, marble ryle, onion, etc...), and all natural. And most importantly, they taste really good.  Picking up a loaf of the onion rye has already become a weekly ritual for me. They also have specialty pastries, tortillas, etc. Though I haven't tried those yet, they look good, and the prices are also very reasonable.

The produce is also good. It's not a huge selection, but the prices are fair and the quality seems good. It's great to have locally grown items available nearby.

Everyone who works there is super friendly, which is great, and they seem to be open long hours, which is really convenient.

The down-side: As I said, very limited selection. The dry goods vary between local (mostly) and mass-produced (some random items). Some of the local artisan products look great, but they're very expensive. I think they'd be a little cheaper at an actual farmers' market (ie, where we're buying direct from the producer)--but I do plan to save up so I can try the pasta, etc.

Weirdly, this place rounds out its selection of local/natural stuff with mass-produced crappy candy, ice cream bars, toilet paper, etc. I can't help but wish they'd found some greener alternatives.

Yes, the pork was very tender, but the salt was -shall I put it nicely?- aggressive. Sam Kinneson aggressive. The ""tortilla"" was an inedible science experiment.

The food came pretty quickly and was warm. We didn't order any drinks because the fresh-squeezed one's are so expensive it's actually cheaper to buy one of their smoothies. The hawaain special- composed of 2 fried eggs, shredded Kalua Pork, cabbage and rice- was tasty, but a little bland. They gave my brother and I (we ordered the same thing) some soy sauce, but I would have preferred a nice dollop of ketchup instead of the sodium infested kikkoman. Other than that, the dish was delicious. They fried the eggs perfectly, the runny yolk making the rice and pork taste even better! I usually only like my eggs over-hard, so it was a pleasant surprise.

My mom opted for the healthy option, getting the yogurt parfait. In my opinion, this was the disappointment of the table. My mom claimed that she loved it and that it tasted like Beijing's yogurt. My mom must have some really refined tastebuds because all I tastes was some store bought low-fat vanilla. The granola was good and the berries fresh and few. What can you expect for $5?

One last thing, the hostess at this place sold me on coming when I called for information. Very well trained and passionate about her job",0,1,1,6.5,"Positive","4"

Crackers & Co. is great food at great prices and we always take out-of-town guests there when visiting!

I was never a fan of eggs unless they were scrambled or in an omelette, but Crackers showed me the way to delicious fried and poached eggs!  The Eggs Benny is great, both Traditional and California-style. Their omelettes are huge and never overcooked (my fave: Spinach Mushroom) . The skillets are mighty tasty and really satisfying (my fave: The Vatican with eggs over easy). Try their French toast... it's got great flavor and is delightfully crispy. 

If you get a chance, try lunch there! Their soups are so scrumptious and the sandwiches are to die for! The Cream of Spinach and Artichoke soup tastes just like a bowl of spinach and artichoke dip, and they don't skimp on the artichokes at all! The Chicken Dumpling soup is seriously the best I've ever had (I'm not even a fan of dumplings!)! The Roma Tomato Chicken Melt is my favorite sandwich on the menu (such good flavor!), followed closely by the Drunken Chicken sandwich. Their burgers are quite good and along with their salads, they serve up a hefty portion!

I did like the cultural shows, such as the taiko and the martial arts demonstrations, and the shaded area with the bonsai and akitas was nice.

After a few months without a manicure or pedicure I decide to treat myself to a manicure this past week.  I went in and a lady did a beautiful job on my gel manicure.  She paid attention to detail and didn't rush through the whole process.  I didn't have time to get a pedicure so I decided to come back the next day.  I only wish that I had her do my pedicure yesterday ... 

The guy who did my pedicure had some sort of infection on his thumb.  I didn't notice it at first because he was using gloves but when it was time for the foot massage he took his gloves off, revealing it.  Tracy was doing someone else's nails right in front of me and clearly saw that he had some sort of sore or fungus on his nail.  It was completely black and it looked like something was growing out of it.    I was shocked that she didn't tell him to at least put his gloves back on.  The ""massage"" that he gave me was hardly any massage at all.  He did the same motion over and over while concentrating on the tv.  Definitely not worth the $25.   The worst part is that he gave me an ingrown toe nail.  The whole right side of my nail is swollen and I just hope that I don't get an infection.

One tablemate's entree (Ginger veggie stir-fry?) arrived at least 20 minutes before the second tablemate saw hers (Yellow Curry).  It was at least another ten minutes before the third tablemate saw his, and so on...  I was able to sample my neighbors' dishes of Spicy Catfish (battered and fried catfish topped w/ bell peppers, basil, and spicy red curry sauce) and Swimming Rama w/ pork (topped w/ peanut sauce over steamed veggies).  All three were AMAZING!  I'll definitely order the Rama and the catfish next time!!!

Didi, our server, moved quickly, was efficient, and attentive, and was even helpful in suggesting alternate selections to those who had never had Thai food before.  She even warned tablemate Ericka, who'd only recently discovered peanut butter as an entree ingredient, that she'd either love or hate the Rama.

In the last few months (or possibly more), this restaurant changed names (it was previously 'The Counter') and cleared out the retail boutique area to make room for more seating.

Future yelper Nancie S suggested we meet for lunch here today, and I was impressed with the changes.  By no means is Chloe's Corner a high end restaurant... it's more like a retro diner with a modern feel.  It's the kind of place you order at the counter and pay for it, and then they bring your food to your table when it's ready.  It's also great for those who want to pick up something quick on the go...

We both ordered the chopped salad and a side of toasted cranberry walnut bread.  It was really tasty!  You can tell they use high quality ingredients... the salad is a unique combination of field greens, turkey, bleu cheese, walnuts, and grapes with poppyseed dressing.  I would for sure order it again although the tuna melt looked pretty amazing too!  There are several other 'classic' items on the menu such as grilled cheese, tomato soup, milkshakes, etc...

Even more impressive than the lunch was the fact that I found a parking spot right away at Kierland and I left without going into one single store.  I'm so proud of myself for that... any fellow shop-a-holics know how hard that can be!

Although I did like this place when it was ""The Counter,"" it looks to me like the change that Fox Restaurant Concepts made to this restaurant was a good one!",4,5,3,7,"Positive","5"

I tried (4) flavors and they ranged from OK to YUMMMMMM!  Vanilla with chocolate buttercream was ok, the Coconut was good (a bit dry, but decent flavor), the Carrot was very good, and the Mocha was YUMMMMMM!   They were all super sweet though.  My husband and I both had a quarter of each flavor and that was more than enough.  

From a flavor variety and taste perspective, Sprinkles is a 3.5 - 4.  However, I really can't justify spending $14.00 for (4) cupcakes.  They are expensive so they can pay their overhead and lease costs, not because of exotic ingredients or special decorating skills.  Don't get me wrong, I'm sure they use good ingredients, but the wrappers are plain, there's no special piping or fondant work, and the flavors are standard. They are just plain good cupcakes...not fantastic, but good.  Certainly not worth $3.50 a cupcake.  I do a ton of baking and I get special order requests from friends and neighbors all the time.  I always do nice decorating and use premium ingredients and the most I charge is $2.00 a cupcake...and that's only if I use fondant.",0,1,0,8.5,"Positive","4"

My friend and I have had experiences such as standing at the host stand with no assistance for several minutes while several employees made eye contact. Of course, no one asked if we had been helped, until the hostess finally made her way back up to the stand and decided to ignore us for another couple of seconds before she even acknowledged us. 

Another visit we were seated right away however it took over 15 minutes for our server to come to our table, and that was only after I had to get out of my seat and find one of the employees to ask for our server. I know several people saw us just sitting there, the least they could have done was asked if we had been helped or not. 

This last experience, was about a year after the last. I thought maybe they would have changed. I most definitely thought wrong! We were seated promptly and the server was there right away this time. However, our food took FOREVER! Literally, it took over 30 minutes for a medium rare steak and a plate of pasta. I know for a fact they messed something up and ended up taking food out of a to go container and placing it on the plate that they then brought to me (you can see right into their kitchen from the dining room). The server never apologized nor did she come and tell us what the hold up was.

The meat tasted like it had been frozen multiple times and lacked flavor. The tortilla tasted like it was store bought and made of paper. The beans were flavorless. The rice was hard and lacked any flavor. Moving to the vegetables: shredded plastic is not actually a vegtable. This is some of the worst tasting, most over priced Mexican food I had had. It would be one thing if it was reasonably priced, but $10 for taco is a absurd amount for a worst than fast-food taste. 

The margarita was good, but $10 for a margarita is a bit on the high side.

But it's kinda pricey. I ultimately paid like $8 for a bagel with lox, cream cheese, and a bag of chips. Seriously?? I mean, yes, it was one of the best bagels I've ever had but I could've gone next door to Senor Taco and gotten a burrito for $3 less and have enough for a dry-cleaning job at the $2.25 cleaners adjacent!

The loroco with cheese has become our favorite, But this past week, I strayed from our standard and tried the gallina soup with braised chicken and salad. All I can say is, ""What the hell?

Two huge Styrofoam cups to go with lemon wedges and 4 hot and fresh tortillas cost less than $6.00. I was stunned. The owner said it costs more with meat. Believe me, you won't miss it.

This is my first dog, and my first experience with a groomer.  I called on a Saturday and had to make an appointment for the next Saturday, so they are busy.

I asked the front desk guy where the price/package list was.  He said they didn't really have a 'list' so I told him what I needed and I wanted to know how much it would be.  He went in back and the groomer came out to take a look at him and talk to me.  She quoted me $38 and I asked how much for teeth, she added on $5.  They gave me a guide to determine how short I wanted him cut and asked me specifics on what type of cut (I said shave him, it's summer).  they asked about ears, tail, etc.

I brought him in at 9 and they had me pick him up at 1.  I don't know a lot about grooming yet but they said depending on how he was under the blower he might need to be kennel dried.  When I came back at 1 they were finishing up his head.  I can imagine he might have been a tough client, given that he is still puppy-hyper and not yet accustomed to the spa treatment.  He was blow dried for sure; His former curly hair was completely straight and soft.  

The shop is no frills.  No pretty sign out front and no decorating inside.  I think they could make more money with some product around or maybe charge more if there was a little more spa feeling when you walk in, but I will go back again for sure.  

My poodle mix is 6 months old and this was his second cut.  (The first was done by a family member).  My poor puppy went in looking like a mess and I didn't recognize him when he came out!  He was soft, had a nice cut and smelled great, even his breath!",0,0,0,3.5,"Positive","4"

I can't remember the first time I came here, but it was some time ago after I moved out here. The convention center has an older part thats smaller, and a new addition that's huge!  Plenty of events are held here all year round, from sporting events like the NBA all star game, to the auto show, they had an NRA convention a couple years ago with a zillion people, along with other regular yearly events like the auto show and several others.

The place is large, and has 3 levels (a basement area, main level and upper level) with a crosswalk to get to the other side which is pretty darn cool. It's huge, spacious, and modern looking with its updates.  Escalators, stairs, etc.  The place is sparsely decorated with Arizona stuff that makes it really cool looking. They also have a cool light feature outside that illuminates the walkway with different colors at night and is really pretty to look at as well.

The cool thing about it is too is that its easily accessible via light rail, and you don't have to spend $$ on parking...and let me tell you, the parking here isn't cheap! $12 for the garage, $10 in lots around, and its not any cheaper the farther away you get.  I don't know why anyone would want to park down here, since the light rail is $3.50 round trip, so save yourself a few bucks and take the rail. You'll thank me later!

There's also food and dining in here as well, with a variety of different style resturants, but again, its outrageously expensive!  They have a starbucks here too, which is their regular prices, but is like an extra $5 a person to eat here, so dine elsewhere before you come in here.  (minus the coffee since Starbucks is the only reasonably priced place in here.)  Plus, the convention center is a hop, skip and a jump from about a zillion other cool dining places that your better off eating at anyways, so do that instead.

We were surprised at how busy they were on a Tuesday night, but we were able to snag a table on their beautiful covered patio. The atmosphere was nice, and i was surprised at the range of patrons (a family of 5 with 3 fairly young children at one table, and a 10-top of blue hairs right next to us). Our server Charlie was very nice and helpful when it came to selections (from wine to food). We are trying out places in prep for a family visit, so we want to make sure we get a good sapling of the menu.

We ordered a bottle of sauv blanc, and though the wine was delicious, it took about the half the meal for Charlie to bring out the marble chiller. Thankfully the wine started out pretty cold, so no harm no foul. I orderd a bowl of tortilla soup (one of my faves) and I was impressed witht he presentation and taste. The bring the bowl with the chicken and tortilla strips out then pour the broth from a pot right at your table. Helps keep the tortilla strips crisp and was a great presentation. The soup was delicious, though a little creamier than i normally like my tortilla soup. We also ordered the seared ahi with guac and THAT was amazing. The pepitas crackers were delicious and interesting and the ahi was perfect. Great app for sure. Plus, the bread and butter were super delicious too. Garlic biscuits, mini corn bread and pepper butter? so good!

For entrees the boyfriend ordered the bacon wrapped pork loin over grits and I ordered the signature Dr. Pepper BBQ Baby Back Ribs. We subbed fries for asparagus and green beans and ordered an extra side of their green chile mac and cheese. I know, a lot of food, but we planned on taking most of it home. Here's where it got interesting. Or should I say, boring. 

So far everything (except the chiller) had been delivered timely and was tasty. But when we realized we'd been waiting 30 mintues or so for our entrees to come (after they'd taken away our apps), it started to get a little annoying. After about 40-45 mintues, the manager came over and leet us know our tray of food had been dropped and had to be re-made. No problem! I understand accidents happen. But i think it would've done a lot to smooth us over if they'd told us right away the spill had happened rather than waiting until we were about eat the burger off the table next to us. RF did recognize the inconvenience though and completely took care of us when the bill came. So props to them for that, and we didn't even complain or ask for any special treatment.

When the food finally arrived, the ribs were OUTSTANDING. the sauce was perfect, not to sweet, not to flat. And the meat was literally falling off the bone. The veggies were all good, but the really show-stopper was the mac and cheese. The crumble top was delicious and the cheese was melted and runny but not stringy or clumpy. Spicy from the green chiles but perfectly reasonable. I want another kettle of them right now. So good. The boyfriends dinner was also good, but i think my ribs and the mac and cheese were really the best part.

We boxed everything up and ordered the huckleberry bread pudding to go. I was disappointed they no longer do the pineapple upside down cake, which so many yelpers have recommended, but I loved the bread pudding as a substitute. the buttery sauce didn't reheat very well at home, but it was still very very good and the ice cream was a perfect complement. I would totally order it again. Like a muffin fresh from the oven, still a little gooey.

"5409","aDBncnQvoMB9jh7_kFpBEA","3","I've got alot of nice and not-so-nice things to say about Phoenix's latest venture into building serious public transportation.

Nice Thing #1: Mainly because it's new, the cars are really clean. After living in LA and using the metro subway there, anything seems cleaner than that. Let's just hope they keep up the cleanliness of the light rail in the years to come.

Nice Thing #2: It gets me from A to B with little to no problems. It gets the job done. Also, it's one of Phoenix's more serious efforts at going green, so it's worth backing.

Nice Thing #3: All of the current downtown stops are well thought out. Once you step off, something is always walking distance.

Nice Thing #4: The price of the all-day pass is worth it.

Nice Thing #5: Unlike public transportation in LA, the light rail is generally on time and makes for a reliable means of getting around. There don't seem to be any car companies that are trying to choke-hold the city by shutting any stations down like they did in the 30's in LA.

The cons...

Bad Thing #1: The only logic in taking the light rail is that it's essentially a car you don't have to park or fill up on gas. It's not that it's slow, but it really only goes slightly faster than the cars driving next to it in the street. Part of the sluggishness of the light rail stems from the fact that it has to stop at traffic lights like the cars you decided not to drive. I think the smarter idea would've been to build the light rail above or under ground so it could have gone faster and not have to stop at lights or risk the chance of some idiot gunning it and T-boning one of the passenger cars.

Bad Thing #2: I know this experiment is still in its training wheels stage, but I really wish that they would build a line that would go to North Phoenix, Scottsdale, or Glendale. I've heard that they are planning a Glendale route, but that's probably going to take another ten years. Even though I live a few blocks from one of the stops, I really wish I wasn't limited to downtown, Tempe, or Mesa.

Bad Thing #3: No airport stop? I mean, there is, but you have to take a shuttle to the actual airport. Why not just build a stop there? It would make more sense.

Bad thing #4: Why does this thing shut off at 11? Is Phoenix trying to kill any chance of building a real nightlife downtown? We're not children. This city shouldn't set a curfew before midnight on this.

In all, the Valley Metro Rail is more yay than nay. It's got its kinks that it still needs to work out and it's kinda tough to judge something that's in what I hope is a very nascent form of what it will eventually become.",2,1,1,2,"Positive","4"

"5415","QI-IdMppjmKgfm_ZxUSv2Q","2","We chose this place for breakfast this morning because of the wonderful reviews on yelp.  I was certain it was going to be one of my new favorite places. 

We entered into a brightly painted orange restaurant and stood at the hostess stand for a few minutes waiting for the hostess to finish flirting with the server and notice us.  She clearly didn't want to be there and could care less where we sat, so opted for the table in the window.  

We sat and waited and waited and waited.  Tables that were sat after us already had their drinks and they were not busy.  Finally I tried to get the attention of the hostess who was standing half asleep at the hostess stand, mouth open wide, eyes half closed.  A few minutes later we finally had a server.

Our server was not very friendly.  I don't even think she said good morning.  We ordered.  Tables sat after us already got their food and we finally got our drinks.  She bought out 2 cups of coffee, but I did not order coffee so I made her take that back. 

Our food finally arrived.  We ordered french toast which came with strawberries, bananas and a cinnamon sauce, eggs benedict with crab cakes and two orders of country potatoes. 

Breakfast was pretty good.  I enjoyed my crab cake and the cinnamon sauce on the french toast was a nice added touch.  The potatoes were not good, they had WAY too much pepper on them, I couldn't even eat them.  Gary ate a few of his after he drowned them in ketchup.

We never saw our server again.  We got a water refilled after we finished our meal.  AND THE WAIT BEGAN.  We waited and waited and waited for our check.  Tables that were sat when we finished eating had already finished their food.  We never saw our waitress. I guess we were her only table, if not I felt bad for her other tables as well. 

Finally some guy brought us our check and tried to drop it off and run, I said WAIT and gave him my card and said, ""If I don't give this to you now it may be 20 more minutes before we see someone again""

Because I didn't look at the bill first when he brought it back I didn't notice until after I paid that they charged me $12.05 for the eggs benedict when their menu actually said $10.50.  I didn't say anything...  I just left a sad tip.

We were there for OVER an hour, they had lots of empty tables, and we only saw our server once.

Gary and I always over tip, because he and his family owned restaurants in the Valley for 35 years.  He has spent a lot of time being a chef and serving tables.  We know that when food comes out wrong, it's probably not the servers fault, and things happen, so we still tip well.  TODAY, I felt like we were invisible and I have no idea where our server disappeared to for the hour.  

We drove by Over Easy, La Grande Orange and IHOP to try this place.  We probably will not be back... unless we decide to give it a second try on jazz night... I do love jazz.",1,6,0,5,"Positive","5"

Don't get me wrong, I still love JFG; I just didn't care for its BBQ pulled pork sandwich and fries.  The coleslaw was good, but not so fantastic that it's worth the pain after.  I thought that the pork had too much of the cloyingly-sweet sauce.  Wasn't so sweet when paired w/ the garlic toast points.  However, if you look at the included photo, you'll see that the two pieces of bread were under the pork, and therefore completely saturated w/ sauce.  I like accompanying bread to be crispy/crusty (love that crunch!), so all I had to enjoy that afternoon w/ the pork was the part that stuck out from under all that sauced meat!  What a waste (tsk, tsk)!  The boat of fries was just a complete soggy mess.  I should've asked them to sub sweet potato fries instead, but why must I pay extra to get a perfectly crisped product?  Then again, one (wo)man's treasure is another (wo)man's trash, and vice-versa, eh?

Before we even entered the bar, as my friend and I were walking up two redneck bikers whispered, ""Fags"" as we walked by them.  I don't think these were the kind of guys you argued with so I let it go.  When we entered the bar I noticed several ""No firearms"" signs plastered on the walls.  I'm assuming they've had a problem with this before.  Remember that scene in the Blues Brothers where they go to the country bar and get the look of death from the patrons?  That's how I felt.  The decor of this bar was interesting.  It looked as if they got the tables and chairs from an old 70s Vegas casino.

We went to the bar to do some karaoke, but apparently they also sell crappy jewelry for some reason?  Weird.  I've also never heard so much cussing from karaoke singers.

The Pho was better though they seemed quite stingy on the accoutrement, as I got two jalapeno slices and a sorry looking stem of basil.

Yet.

Let me explain.

1) Rose & Crown - The Hours. If it is really meant to be a British pub and a new asset to downtown nightlife, it needs to strongly declare A) YES! WE ARE OPEN! and B) YES! WE ARE OPEN *LATE*! When you're turned away when you excitedly show up at midnight on a Saturday because they decided to close for whatever reason, you're not going to be too excited about trying to go back the next time. What's a British pub doing closing so early? I went out of my way to go here, to experience this new bar and enjoy its offerings, and was sent packing. Meh. So I was surprised when a bunch of Yelpers decided to make it a meetup spot a few weeks later. Well, maybe this time, at 10:30, we'd be more fortunate with it staying open. 

And we were. Rock on.

2) Rose & Crown - The Setting. I gather that the business owners are extremely limited with how much they can change with the house since it's probably a landmark with stringent regulations on how much of the interior can be changed, but since I've eaten at Circa 1900 a number of times before it vacated the premises, walking in here felt exactly the same. Sitting at the EXACT same 4-top table I ate before. The room hadn't changed one iota when it came to layout or furniture. Even the angles the tables were placed at. That was a little odd. The only main changes in the front west room were the giant visages of the Queen and good ol' Winston glaring down at you. In any case, it was kind of hard for me to make the mental transition from ""this is a sit-down restaurant"" to a ""this is going to be your local English pub"" when it comes to the indoors. Was it nice? Definitely. It's really nice inside. But pubby? No. That said, the front balcony is a really great location to hang out on, and I can imagine how great it'll be around springtime. But the balcony's more an asset of the great old house itself. 

3) Rose & Crown - The offerings. Standard selection of beers, including good ol' English standbys like Newcastle and Boddingtons on tap. Food menu not too big, but I thought the fish & chips looked appetizing, so I ordered those. I was skeptical, but to my surprise, the fish was great, as was their spin on the tartar sauce. Fries were also tasty, but fries are fries, and I'm going to devour them anyway because I was crazy hungry. But all in all, thumbs up on the food.

4) Rose & Crown - The service. Was kind of there but more present at the beginning and then invisible near the end when were ready to leave, thus having to go back inside, tell the bar manager what we ordered since he didn't have the bill, and then pay him instead of our server. Kind of odd.

So all in all, as I said already, 3.67 stars. I'm definitely willing to go back there and be open to editing my review and increasing its star wattage, but for now, it hasn't completely won me over.

 We started off with the jess Jess boneless wings- Delish!!!!! Not wet like other wings in fact I think they coat them and then throw them on the grill. We Loved them!

This was a quick lunch with my best friend Melissa and was well worth it!!  

We were greeted by the counter person with a warm welcome and when I advised I had never been here before, she took me through a quick tour of the menu and suggested what to order.  Following her suggestions was a great choice!  

We both had the same thing, The Hawaiian BBQ Mix.  This comes with BBQ Chicken, BBQ Beef and Kalbi Short Ribs.  I also added Teriyaki sauce to the Chicken.  The meals came with 2 scoops of rice, a single scoop of macaroni salad and veg.  

The flavors were wonderful, the beat tender and juicy.  The ribs were a thin slide and you had to navigate around the bones but it was delicious!

For months I have been threatening to stop by but never have,  Now I am sad for all I have missed!!  Definitely going back!!

Then one evening, we placed our order asking for the special we always get, a 2 pizza deal.
When we received our order, they placed 2 medium pizzas on our table. I immediately asked about the pizza size as we had always received 2 large pizzas as advertised.  It turns out they have 2 specials, a 2 medium pizza deal and a 2 large pizza deal.
The employee never asked which deal and the fact that we were there with 5 people should have prompted them to ask me to specify which deal.
I spoke to the owner of this location he agreed to make us another medium pizza to make up the size difference to which I agreed to.
Nearly 10 minutes later, the owner came to our table and told us that if he made us another pizza, he was going to have to charge us for it.
I refused and now nearly 2 years later, we have chosen not to return to this establishment. 
My money is important to me and it should be as important to any business, especially a small local business...
I now choose a place slightly further away, but one that appreciates its customers.

But, as far as the food goes - it's bland. I've been here on two separate occassions other than work, and while the atmosphere is beautiful (the seats and booths are roomy and comfy and there are even more seats that stretches out to the back, leading to a small ""VIP"" section), the food is just not that great.",0,0,0,4,"Positive","4"
"5556","lW4G0t6AI3lZQ6QSmv8DGA","2","BBQ has to be one of my favorite foods and when a co worker suggested this place I was all for it.  Living on the west side it was quite the drive but being that I am a BBQ fanatic I had to see what this was all about.  

First off Lucille's has a good location.  Its located by Dave and Buster in the Tempe Marketplace.  The look of the place is gimmicky but in a Famous Dave's kinda way.  They have old school signs, mason jars to drink out of, and all the little fake things to make you seem like you have gone to Memphis or where ever they are trying to transport you.

The service was absolutely awful.  It took way to long to get drinks and even longer to get refills.  Attitude the whole time.  Here is a tip if you want a good tip bust your butt.  Then you will have more money to pay for your tuition (half the staff is college kids).  And do not roll your eyes when I don't want to try your suggestions.  They tell you they smoke all their meats in house im not impressed.  

Now onto the most important part the BBQ.  We had the brisket,half chicken and rib tips with a side of greens and sweet potato fries. 

The chicken was good.  It had a smoke on it and was tender not real complaints.  The portion size was good.

Brisket was dry and you couldn't cut it with a fork.  That tough.  Maybe over smoked?  Portion size tiny.  4 strips maybe 3 or 4 inches long.

Rib Tips were dry and covered in sauce.  Hardly any meat on them.  Most places in the valley load you up on Rib Tips when you order they are a cheap meat.  But not this place.  You get a scoop full.  Boo.

Collard greens were disgusting.  Cooked in some weird pork parts and they were bitter.  Greens are not supposed to be bitter if cooked right!

Sweet Potato Fries.  You can't really mess these up they probably came frozen.  So I would recommend these over regular fries.

The starter of a biscuit with sugar on top was just weird.  WEIRD WEIRD WEIRD.  And the biscuit wasn't even warm enough to melt the sugar I mean apple butter. 

One last thing the house and spicy BBQ sauce's main ingredients are CORN SYRUP thats how they thicken it! seriously that should tell you something.

Easy to find (sign on the street corner) on a charming and quiet little street sits The Breadfruit with a hostess standing out front greeting guests. You can see the very intimate seating area from the street and it was packed (a good thing for 8:30pm on a Friday night). We sat and waited outside at the cute little tables (way too hot to eat a full meal outside). We were offered menus to peruse while we waited about 10 minutes for a table.

Inside, we ordered two mixed drinks (a mojito vanilla for me). They were strong and very good. The mojito was very minty and refreshing and my mojito-loving friend said he should have ordered a mojito. (Read: Get a mojito.)

The Food: We split a tilapia patty (very spicy!) for an appetizer. (Patties are Jamaican empanadas.) 
I had the coconut curried tofu with rice and peas, ripe plantains, and veggies. This is the one of the best tofu dishes I have ever had. My only complaint is that Breadfruit needs to have more plantains per plate. They are so good!
One friend had the curried chicken and dumpling with a green banana, veggies, plantains, and a side order of rice and peas. Although he didn't like the whole wheat dumpling, he loved the curry sauce and the green banana. He called the sauce ""delectable.""

We spent our evening downstairs in what I can only describe as ""speak-easy"" atmosphere reminiscent of my days spent in the DC area.  I loved it.  Decor was spot on with stone walls, a fire place with comfy leather chairs strategically placed in front.  A big bar took up most of the room with some comfy look booths placed around the outskirts of the room. Lots of great details in decorations and design.  Our bartender was friendly and efficient. His suggestions on wine (1/2 price bottle!) and the manhattan we had were spot on.  He checked in with us and was attentive, but not overly so, letting us enjoy each other's company.  

We tried 3 of the small plates:  the roasted pepper bruschetta, tenderloin skewers and the bacon wrapped shrimp.  Honestly, I was expecting to be hungry afterwards and was ready to order something else in addition to that, but we held off until we received our food and I'm glad we did. The portions were pretty large and food rich.  Everything tasted great...the bacon and tenderloin were served on long plates that had 3 different sauces...a creamy queso (I think), a spicy red sauce and a green tomatillo-like sauce.  The red and green were really good - the white was a bit bland....but I'm also not a fan of cream sauces, so don't take my word for it.  The bruschetta was more of an italian style bruschetta (bread, peppers layered on top with melted cheese).  Tasted good, but my only complaint would be that it got a little mushy because there was so much topping on it. My date enjoyed it.

The food was decent, and the atmosphere OK but seriously, how can this place cost as much as it does ($60+ for two people eating light)?? And how are people fawning all over it? I don't like to complain about a good meal, and indeed this meal was good but I can't seem to justify the cost as compared to most any other place I have tried in Phoenix that would be considered in St. Francis' class. 

I ordered a Hearts of Romaine Salad and a bowl of cauliflower soup. I shared a plate of the baked goat cheese with my guest. Not one of these dishes would have tasted much different had I made them myself from ingredients at the Public Market. Indeed, I have had cauliflower soup at the market that tasted just as good for a fraction of the price.

The service was good, I will say, and for that I would offer a higher rating. But the general ambiance of pretension was more than I could justify, again for a meal I feel like I have had 100 times before. 

In the end I guess I would say if they would knock about $10 off of each plate, and cut some of the pretentious attitude, I would probably be offering a much  better review.

"5700","xCt-gSne_IoKyFG6JU6fRQ","5","Staying at the Royal Palms has been on my bucket list for a while now, because I've stayed at just about every other resort in town that I've really wanted to check out.  Oddly enough, this also happens to be the closest one to where I actually live, so it seems strange to drop a load of cash to stay in a hotel four miles away from home.  

No matter, last month was my golden birthday and this is where my lovely girlfriend decided we were going to stay.  Score.  We had my party (a surprise, nicely pulled off) and we invited a bunch of people back to our room afterwards to continue the festivities.  It was a pretty standard room, a bed, fireplace, a couple of chairs, big bathroom, a table and chairs on the patio (I believe they call it a valencia suite).  Life was grand.

Until the morning.  *bang bang*  WTF is that noise?  *bang bang*  There was pounding and various noises coming from the room next to us, and it wasn't happening on the bed.  Are they really doing construction at 8:15am?  It continued.  My girlfriend called down to the front desk.  The noise stopped.  Then it continued.  *bang bang*  We were about to lose it. They called our room, ""do you mind if they continue working?"".  Actually, we had just fallen back asleep...

So this is not how the Royal Palms treats their guests.  No, any resort with a Director of Romance is serious about making their guests stay enjoyable, so I knew this was not normal.  A conversation took place, and profanity and yelling wasn't even necessary.  Essentially, they were going to comp our room, but they offered that we stay another night in the presidential villa for the same price...how could we say no?

I hung out at the resort all day because I was feeling miserable.  They comped lunch, and about 4pm, they moved us to our new room.  Nice place, the presidential villa.  It's actually only one bedroom, but has a huge living room, dining room, kitchen, two fireplaces, three patios with fireplaces and water feature, old-school tub, double-shower with outdoor shower, a bidet,  you know...typical amenities.  I was still feeling terrible (yay, the flu!) , so we opted to order room service from T. Cooks.  Naturally, if they hadn't done enough, they comped dinner as well.

We had an extremely atypical experience at the Royal Palms our first night, I have no question about that.  But they more than made up for it.  They were gracious, they smiled, they apologized, and they made it right immediately.  I can't ask for anything more from that from a place that prides itself in its customer service.

The villa had it's own kitchen fully equipped with a fridge, stove, sink and even had cups and glasses. There was a little seating area by the kitchen as well.

The bedrooms were both a good size and the master bedroom had a huuuuuge bathroom. It also had his and her's sink and tons of space. I was sad that I didn't get to use the shower because it was a walk-in shower and was spacious.

The central Phoenix restaurant and bar is owned by Postino owner Craig DeMarco (and it's right across the street from the central Phoenix Postino), and the atmosphere and vibe are similar to Postino's. Windsor also has an open dining room that extends to the patio, the lighting is also dim, and the servers are also hip.

I thought the toppings were interesting both taste- and texture-wise, and that part of the meal seemed relatively healthy. I paired it with some macaroni and cheese, which I enjoyed, though my pal and I weren't wowed. Maybe it's because the cheese wasn't plentiful or creamy enough, but it was still good.

I went with a friend who lived in Germany for a bit and he said that Murphy's wasn't quite up to par. 

We ordered the sausage sampler as an appetizer. The sausages were tasty, but they were a bit cold. For something that is labeled a ""sampler"", I felt disappointed with only two types of sausages served in it. I don't know for sure what types they were, but they didn't taste unique to me, as it seems like you can purchase them in the meat section of any supermarket. 

The sausages were served with three types of condiments. A sweet style mustard, a Dijon style mustard, and ketchup blended with curry, which I'm told is a recent favorite of the German kids brought over from Turkish immigrants. 

For our entrees, we all had some type of schnitzel. That same friend told me to try the Wiener schnitzel as it is the representative item when you think of German cuisine. So all our schnitzel's came out and mine was the blandest. My friend's schnitzels had different gravies, toppings, and stuff and my poor little Wiener schnitzel was just bland and all alone. You have to get that Wiener schnitzel wet with gravy ! 

No biggie, I'm a foodie so I'll eat it. A schnitzel is basically German country fried pork. Not super exciting. I copied my friend who lived in Germany and substituted potatoes on the side for spatzle, as I wanted this experience to be as authentic as possible. I don't know if it's just Haus Murphy's, but the spatzle was kind of bland, even with the gravy. 

I do however like the word spatzle. If I ever visited Germany, I would only say spatzle, to everyone. I also liked the other thing that was served with the entree. It was kind of like a mashed potato mixed with some creme sauce, onions and some kind of green vegetable or herb (probably spinach). 

The beer here was good authentic German beer. I didn't get drunk, but I still don't remember what kind I had, you'll have to experiment. 

Service was excellent. I read some reviews that said Murphy's was slow but everything came out quickly and evenly for us. The waitress was very friendly and they spoke lovely German (not that I speak ANY German, but it sounded sexy). She was very helpful in describing everything, from the food to the beer.

I ordered a BAP (big ass pretzel) to go. Philly is known for some pretty good pretzels and this BAP was good. It was expensive, but it came out warm, soft & chewy. The only thing is they went a little heavy on the salt. 

To steal and modify a quote from a Seinfeld episode: ""That big ass pretzel made me thirsty""!  

Note* They don't actually have it on the menu as a BAP.

So i was here this week.  Let me start by saying i have been giving Los Dos Molinos my  business for almost 20 years now, and each year that goes by i find myself saying that i am going to cease my patronage.  I will save the stories from the recent years and why i've been feeling this way, and give you just the specifics from my most recent visit:  If you want to make the rule that there are ""No Split Checks"" then can you AT THE VERY LEAST get with the current times and make the bill somewhat decipherable?  We had a large party, and were quite promptly advised there were no split checks, yet at the end of the night we were left with a ribbon of calculator tape with ONLY prices, and no correlation with actual menu items...so we had to cross reference the menu to figure out what the heck all the itemizations correlated to.   And by the end of it, we pretty much gave up and just guessed at what each person should contribute because the receipt may have just as well been in morse code.  Ok, im getting ahead of myself..Its one thing if you have subpar service and the restaurant is slammed, understaffed, there is a MLB baseball game or NBA basketball game, or concert going on...This was not the case.  We were the ONLY table inside the restaurant and the service absolutely sucked.  How many times must one flag down the server for (take your pick) A;  refill on chips B: refill on ice water and C:(most importantly since the drinks are marked up 300%) a FRESH DRINK!!! Oh yes and D: Check please.  We had to look over our shoulders for A , B, C, and D.  When our table collectively decided the service was ridiculous we decided the tip would reflect that, and then we realized an 18% gratuity was included...well no wonder.  When that is the case, there is NO incentive for decent service!! We brought several items to the attention of the bald headed caucasian man who may have been a manager of some sort but his severe lack of customer service skills merely resulted in him stating in a childish voice ""They are complaining about the service"" to an audience that didnt exist.

What I don't get is the awful food. This was my FIRST (and last) visit into this franchise restaurant. How they convinced franchisees and the general public to invest and vote with hard earned dollars is beyond me.

I took my friends 11 year old there after he played in a b'ball game and after looking at the menu and pricing decided to split the rib eye special $19.99. 

I got the fried pickle appetizer as well and was sorely disappointed in the batter and both of the ""dipping sauces"" (watery ranch and thousand island? I really couldn't tell).  Even a franchise like H***ers makes them WAY better......wow.

On to the main course. The baked potato with butter and cream cheese was overcooked or something? I have never had a potato that seemed to have been soaked in some type of brine and then baked? Kind of par boiled or something. Anyway the color was greyish and the taste like that of a fishy sea salt.

Moving to the broccoli i was greeted by a palor yellow looking presentation. I couldn't tell if it was cheesy cauliflower or ? Wow the taste was again that of something really overcooked or under matured...YICK

The last chance at redemption came with the medium well rib eye. Good sized portion and easily split between the two of us 20oz. Good wholesome beefy taste and great texture only to be squallored  by a heavy Saltiness....not sure where this was picked up from but maybe by hanging out too close to the potato? 

I really am normally an amicable restaurant patron but after forking over $46 including tip for two to split some food and getting served what we did ...well you get my drift.

I wanted to get my fiancé (girlfriend at that time) a simple diamond pendant necklace for her birthday and could not find anything that even came close to matching her style. I searched the internet for days and reluctantly went into a few jewelry stores hoping for the best, but expecting the worst. I, like most people [guys] out there, had a bad feeling in a few stores I went to. Pushy sales people looking for the upsale, and sky high prices. I was getting very discouraged about the process, but that all changed when I came to Hyde Park. 
The super friendly staff made everything easy for me. There was no pushy sales process or anyone trying to upsell me something I didn't want. They immediately offered me a bottle of water and started to talk to me like a real person. After a few minutes of speaking with a very lovely woman in the store she suggested we think about something custom. At first  I was thinking ""here we go; this is where I am going to get stuck!"", but I was all wrong!!!
We looked a few loose stones and I got a great education about diamonds. I went home later that night and did some research on the internet and found that the prices we as good, or better than any of the big online retailers. I could never get my head wrapped around buying a diamond online, sight unseen, and I am so glad that I found Hyde Park. 

In the end I have used Hyde Park to create a custom pendant diamond necklace that my fiancé absolutely loves (it is perfect on her), and I also used Hyde Park to get the diamond for the engagement ring, as well as everything else to follow. 

Want to know what service is all about in the jewelry business, check out what Hyde Park did for me. I picked out an amazing diamond for the engagement ring (chose the loose stone again) but had no idea what kind of a ring my fiancé would want. So Hyde Park said ""how about we just put it in a classic Tiffany solitaire setting as a temporary setting and then after you give it to her, you can come back in together and pick out the perfect setting and wedding band set"". I was like, seriously?!! You can just do that???

In the end Hyde Park will be my jeweler for life. They helped me create the perfect simple birthday present, and took that service all the way through doing a custom engagement ring and matching wedding band set. This is the jewelry store for any guy who wants great service, great prices, and like me, doesn't have the first clue about how to make the perfect decision.

Happy Hour - San Felipe's has one of the best happy hours in the valley. Their drinks and appetizers are half off from 4pm-7pm, and my bill for drinks and dinner with friends is typically $20-$30. You can't beat that!

Service - I usually sit up at the bar when I stop by, and they have some of the friendliest bartenders in town! They always make me feel at home when I stop by, and they're quick to serve me during the late-night hours. The managers are also really good about hanging out and chatting with the customers to make them feel special. It works!

Food and Drinks - My favorite drink at San Felipe's is probably the Mexican Iced Tea. It's a long island iced tea, but they use passion fruit vodka instead of the traditional unflavored vodka. As far as food goes, I REALLY like the baja chicken wrap, the sonoran chicken sandwich, and the steak burrito with green sauce. A quick tip - ANYTHING with the baja sauce is great :)

Get the brisket, get the pork. Get the beans. They're bangin'!!!!!! The sauce is delicious the mac and cheese is pretty good, the cheesy potatoes are good too. The real standouts I would have to say are the brisket and the beans. Do NOT skip the beans. Trust me. 

I'm not even a meat person but I do like Joe's because everything is cooked just right. Order extra of everything and you will be glad you did. Makes for great leftovers. Don't forget to get some BBQ sauce too. Personally, I'm not one to douse everything in BBQ sauce, just a little dip here and there, but the sauces are really good. 

Even my young niece and nephew enjoy the food. It's simple, down-home good food even the pickiest eaters can enjoy. I've never actually dined-in at this place. I've always called in an order for pick up or ordered right at the take-out window. They are pretty fast.

My future father-in-law wants me to choose Joe's to cater our wedding rehearsal dinner. Did I really ever imagine in my wildest princess wedding dreams that I would choose BBQ for my rehearsal dinner? Not really, but Joe's is excellent, and we're heading toward a laid-back wedding theme anyway to take it easy on our many out-of-town family and friends.

HAPPY HOUR ON A SATURDAY!!!

Yes, every day actually! from 3-7pm and a late night happy hour too starting at 10pm!! How can that be true??? Well I guess in Arizona they know how to party! $11 pitchers and $3 pints, yes it could be a little cheaper, but hey it is a happy hour every day of the week! And their beer is really good! AND they will give you FREE samples of all of their beer too!!! This is like brewery heaven!!!

To top it off, a group of people came here in Crank or Drank shirts on their first ever biking and drinking tours and this was on their tour for good reason! Their Hefe is awesome, complete with lemon wedges of course, and their Sunbru was so so refreshing on that hot day in AZ! Adriana and I definitely had our fair share of pitchers, along with an order of their beer battered fries and their specialty ice cream cake! Well, that was actually roopas, and just an FYI, oreo crumb crust and Hefe don't really mix......so save the cake for when you are done drinking ha ha

But the waiters here (the ones that don't look like they are 15!!!!!) are helpful and friendly and nice, and you will definitely get carded here, even though literally I actually felt old here since all the girls look so young! Some of them must have had workers permits I swear!

"5952","IdOyH6WqsEiL2DS8gcYHUw","5","Hospitality Suite Resort was my home away from home this last week and although they are not a posh spa type resort, they were filled with heart and gave me everything I needed in the seven nights I spent there.

Why did I chose Hospitality Suite Resort?  I needed a place for seven nights (eight days) while I worked on my qualifying exams and worked on my dissertation in Phoenix.  I had two basic needs, a place that was cheap and had free internet.  That they had a daily breakfast was a plus, as was laundry facilities.  They had the best price for all these options, so I jumped.

After a flight to Sky Harbor, getting a rental car, driving to Scottsdale, I had a hard time finding the hotel.  I finally asked another hotel on Scottsdale Ave. and she said, ""OH yeah, the numbers are funny that way!""  Ha!  Very funny.  After that first time, I didn't have any trouble finding my way back to it again.  My morning commute to the Hokokum campus was very straightforward.  I was pretty much set.

I was greeted by a fellow named J.J. who talked very fast (or maybe because of my travel and the time, I was processing very slowly).  He gave me a room on the third floor that was ""overlooking the pool"" (P.S. all rooms are ""overlooking the pool"").  He told the best place to park and showed me on the map where the elevator was.  It did take me awhile to find the elevator with my stuff in my hands, but eventually I did.  There were some British/French kiddos hanging out in the poor area, whooping it up and there was music coming from the lounge, but it didn't matter, I was so tired, I could have fallen asleep in a airplane (oh, wait, I did that too!).

The next morning, I took in more of my surroundings.  My room had a lovely little kitchen with all the necessities and a nice large bathroom with a small stall shower.  The was a lovely full-sized ironing board and steam iron.  There was a coffee maker in the kitchen, along with a toaster, microwave, fridge (small) and hotplate.  There was a nice reading lamp over the bed and an easy-to-use clock radio.  There was a desk as well as a table and three chairs.  The king size bed was comfortable, but not overly so.  I certainly had no trouble sleeping while there, but I didn't have a trouble getting out of bed either.  Perfect.

Breakfast was a choice of five breakfasts.  The menus were laminated, meaning the that choices did not change, but that was ok.  I chose two eggs, sausage, hash browns, whole wheat toast, oj and coffee every morning.  By the second day, I was greeted by name.  That was a nice touch, because I felt that I was very very far away from home.

Instead of eating out every night, I went to Food City, just down the road and bought supplies to heat up in the micro. I bought sodas for the fridge and micro popcorn.  Ahhhhh... all the comforts of home.  Because I was up late working on my classwork, the partying didn't bother me.  The pool was a magnet for people, even at night, because it finally was cooling down.  I didn't go to any of the happy hours (friends don't let friend write on their dissertation drunk), but they sure looked like people were having fun!

Doing laundry was a little complex due to my own non-reading of the map.  I made this huge circuitous route because I didn't know there was a laundry room in the part of the hotel I was staying.  Next time I will know!!

All in all, I enjoyed my stay at Hospitality Suite Resort.  Next time I would bring less clothes because of the superb laundry facilities (you don't need to bring quarters because you buy tokens at the lobby).  Next time I would remember to bring a swim suit because those pools looked sooooo good!

Our waitress was fantastic, and talked me into getting the melted cheese on the side. It was quite tasty, indeed it has a bit of skin but generally if you cook cheese or milk included products into a liquid quickly it does get one..and personally I didn't haven't issue about it. 

The menu isn't extensive, it would be nice to have a bigger menu but with how accommodating the are, you could probably something off the wall and they'd be willing to do it.

I ordered the bean and cheese burrito, which is delicious, and large. 
Its a fatty, and I loved it. 
When asked if they cook with lard the hostess had an immediate answer and listed what they used to cook everything with. I was so happy. Most have no idea, and aren't very polite if you ask. She was very friendly like everyone else we encountered there.

I was told that the Steak was perfect, and mr.hard-to-please was filled up (had left overs) and stayed that way the rest of the night. Which was great. The salsa has an interesting flavor, and I must I dig it. I""m not a big fan of mexican rice so I didn't partake in eating it, however the fan of mexican rice at the table liked it, (but not as much as the fajitas) 

Conclusion - Excellent Staff, Great Food (Its Tex-Mex..not just Mex so bare that in mind. There is a difference!) Atmosphere reminds me of some place that would be placed in a Tarantino film.

"5967","EyWncY5l3mARzhoueTDHiw","3","First time eating Cambodian food. I am not sure what it's supposed to taste like so it's hard to say if this is what cambodian food is....

Small, quiet place. Entrance was non-initutive to us for some reason, we walked in the kitchen. It's the door on the left if anyone was curious. 

On a Monday at lunch, we were the only people in there around noon. 

I didn't know what to order but I like shrimp so I went for it. I went  for the Shrimp Ling rice combo. It comes with soup, rice and a pickled salad. 

The dish comes on a nice square plate so it makes the food 50x fancier just because it's on a square plate. Lots of shrimp in my plate ~ about 10ish and they're large. The shrimp was grilled and it tasted good but I wouldn't call it amazingly good that I was in love. I ate it and I like it but I thought to myself 'What is Cambodian food because the flavors don't seem unique? It seems like they grilled it in some soy sauce, maybe sugar, added more salt and maybe one or two other spices."" FYI - There's bunch of green onions in the shrimp, I think they add that more flavor. They aren't chopped into small pieces, it's like the whole stem but I ate everything. I always eat everything - I don't waste my food (it's almost like a sin not to finish your food unless you take it home... so nevermind).

The pickled salad was refreshing. I like the soup, it was lukewarm and it reminded me of a Chinese wintermelon homecooked soup. It's like a mixed of Chinese style chicken broth with Vietnamese beef broth without the saltiness and msg. Adding the green onions to the soup definitely makes it 50x better as well - WOOHOO. 

My dish was $8 - pretty good price. Thumbs up to that!

Overall, would I go back? Eh - I don't know. I need to try other Cambodian places or maybe I should just have googled about it...maybe Vietnamese food is better? Apparently, the countries are located near each other so it's similar to Vietnamese food.",0,2,1,8.5,"Positive","4"

This time, we ordered the Lemon Grass one. Which I highly recommend!!! It was so much better than the Ying-Yang.  

NEVER NEVER NEVER get the quail eggs.  It was a waste of money.  and make sure to get lots and lots of beef slices.  That's like my favorite part of eating hot pot.

My apologies to those who think reviews should focus strictly on food, but atmosphere is what I notice when I walk in the door.  Plus, despite the fact that the place was mostly, we were led to the table closest to the restrooms.  Seriously?  

The star of the show here is obviously the tortas.  I tried the egg one, which had cheese and a very generous serving of sliced avocados.  This torta was delicious and a great value.  The other one I tried had chicken, onions, and some other stuff.  It reminded me of what they have at the Great Steak and Potato Company.  Not that that's a bad thing.  For the tortas I give 5 stars.  

Other stuff:

No alcohol.  'Nuff said.

Greasy potato chips as a side?  That was kind of a bummer.  I was craving tortilla chips or fries or anything a little more exciting than potato chips right out of the bag.

When I set out to Yelp the Safeway across the street from me and the Mr.'s place I thought of using that word to describe how much I don't like this Safeway.  Of course it's warranted, they pissed me off!

Okay you know how they always do BOGOF on milk.. well me and the Mr don't drink that much milk so the cashier usually just gives me half off the 1 gallon. Well this time she forgot to and I didn't notice until I got home.. so seeing that I used to shop here once a week I figured Id just bring my receipt back the following week. Well the following week I went in and showed the receipt and the dumb bitch behind the counter was like, 'what am I supposed to do about it?'.. I explained to her what usually happens as the cashier gives it to me for half off.. she then proceeded to ask me which cashier was doing that, 'it's not our policy.'
After going back and forth for a few minutes I finally just told her to give me my 2 bucks.. she told me if I would have brought them the receipt back the same day they would have done something about it. Are you f-ing kidding me? Whats the difference besides my being inconvenienced having to drive back there. So I finally asked her if she was willing to lose a potential lifetime customer over 2 bucks? She responded, 'there's nothing I can do for you.' I then told her that her customer service skills suck and that I will NEVER return to the store.

1. Dicking us around with the room. Paid for Cabana Room with balcony. First room given - West Wing. Not Cabana. Second room given - Handicapped Cabana Room in back corner, no balcony. Since this was on my boyfriends card, and he didn't want to push for the the Cabana Balcony we wanted, there was nothing I could do. However, I find this highly unacceptable. 

2. Dirty - Every morning, when we left, there were used coffee mugs and coffee pots on the floor in the area in front of the maintenance closet. 

3. Maintenance crew would leave their carts in the middle of the hallway, and we would have to figure out how to move them to get by.

4. Crude comment from their pool guy.

5. Overall, outdated hotel. Not a good vibe at all. Average to below average service. Overall desolate.

"6043","9JX081oVLclNi2NHLL6kFg","5","I saw the reviews of this Arribas and thought to myself, ""Are these people talking about the same Arribas I went to last night?"" I went there, and had an awesome time! Service was prompt, and if something was off, our server Jeff (who was amazing) explained why something happened, but didn't blame anyone, and didn't use server jargon. I do understand the jargon, but it was nice for someone to not have to resort to it. 

Warm chips and salsas + warm bean dip came out = awesome and the spicy salsa was calling my name. It burned, but I loved it. I ordered the Rio Grande enchiladas with the carne abodoba, and ordered it extra spicy. (Of course, I would) I was with my girl (and she likes strawberry margaritas) so we split the house margarita for 2, frozen with sugar of course. I'm not a huge margarita person, but it was really good. She ordered the cheese enchiladas. (She takes safe choices when we go eat) -more on the margaritas in a min- 

Food come out and seriously, it was some of the best spanish/mexican I've had in a while. Its good to see an establishment take risks with seasoning their food. It was fresh! Which is hard to find these days and I'm pretty sure the people who own Arribas own a hatch chile farm because I rarely saw anything about jalapenos or serranos or even habaneros. Which is cool. Those hatch chiles are slanged around that place like coke in studio 54 in the 70's. I'm not kidding, when you order your entree and they ask you what kind of beans you want. Black, pinto, or the 3rd kind that is a combo of black/pinto with some onion, tomatoes, and of course, what's that? Hatch chiles! I highly recommend them. I liked how Arribas uses the hatch chiles. It sets them apart. It brought the heat!

After dinner, I ordered another margarita...

This time, I asked Jeff of a recommendation. Why do I do this? Because the people that work at any restaurant know the food/drinks there more than you will ever know. 'Nuff said. He brought out some margarita I don't even know the name. It kicked my ass, thank god my girl was driving home, that's all I'm going to say. Thanks!

That's why this place gets 5 stars. It deserves it in my opinion.
I think because this place takes chances with seasoning and overall outlook is why so many people might be unhappy with Arribas or this location in general. I on the other hand PROMOTE this thought process. I don't want food that's bland that a place kicks off the line to the people outside than enjoy bland food. That makes for a BLAND place that's filled with, well, bland people. This place uses heat, salt, pepper, and other spices that I don't know of. What a freaking great idea! Too hot for you? Then don't eat food that is 99% based on heat.

Met with a couple people during their soft opening and there was absolutely nothing soft about it.  I got there a few minutes early and posted up at the bar to grab a Manhattan.  This drink is usually my boozometer when I am trying a place first.  Ok, we've got something here, this drink is tasty.  Started talking to the bartenders and got a really comfortable feeling from them.  When was the last time that you sit down to the bar and  they ask your name, tell you their's, and then shake your hand?  

After the manhattan the rest of the group showed.  The bar was a little too busy to fit the three of us so I took my second drink, sazerac, to the table.  Sazerac was tasty as well.  Rest of the table ordered some drinks and nothing negative to be said anywhere.  We each had around 4 or 5 drinks and every last one of them was delicious.

They also have drag racing events, any type of racing event, drift, road, moto races, dirt bikes, monster trucks, top fuel drag boats on the lake... I'm sure I'm missing a lot but nowhere else has this in Az.

Being first timers there, the service staff was very friendly and suggested what menu items we should try - to experience the best they had to offer.

They were served with cotija, pico, and cilantro - adding that truly authentic flavor to the tacos.  We also sampled the fish tacos and burritos.

The new library is BEAUTIFUL!  I'm hoping that without a lot of kid traffic it may be a sanctuary for teachers who want to be able to find the books they need to bring to their classrooms and share with their students.  They don't have as large of a selection as Burton Barr, but they do have some titles you can't find at the other branches.  The shelves are well stocked but not so tightly packed that browsing becomes a chore.  It's peaceful (like a library should be), but it could use some more seating. 

I have to be honest that I find the coolest part of this library to be the tiny cafe at the back - they serve Starbucks coffee and tasty pastries at very decent prices.

We were a party of 6, and I wasn't the only one planning on ordering the seabass... my aunt and I were both disappointed, but what can you do?  I ended up with the shrimp and vegetable terriyaki bowl and my aunt went with the tuna tartar appetizer and edamame.  Others at the table had the scallops, the turkey burger, a steak salad, and scallop entree... Few of us were drinking that night, but we managed to have a good meal.

The manager, Clem, came over to apologize for being out of seabass - that was appropriate; obviously, we knew it wasn't his fault, but the gesture was nice.

I would have bathed in eggs and salsa if only to prolong my experience with this semi-breakfast burrito thing.  I would have married it and had kids with it and bought a house in Michigan nearby a really good school district.  I fell in love with the egg jalapeno burrito thing, I would cuddle with it on weekday mornings and plan trips to national parks with it.

The food is good, I only have a couple CONS....

No low sodium soy sauce and most of the food is VERY salty!

The selection is not great, no calamari or bbq pork and several other items I enjoy.

The only dim sum restaurant I have experienced out here is C FU Gourmet,,, their selection is greater but their downfall is the food is usually cool to warm and the place has been steadily getting worse. (bummer) and the owner just doesnt seem to care.

That's the Trojan Battle Cry!""
Wow, I can not believe someone Yelp'ed PV. 
 My freshman year, my science teacher was arrested from embezzling from the strip joint she owned. We then had a different teacher every couple of weeks for the first half of the year. When we finally got a permanent teacher, the damage was done. The kids had no connection or respect for any teacher who walked in the door anymore.
  The year I graduated, there were 3000 students and over 1000 in my graduating class. We often had 40+ kids in one classroom. 
Man, I hated this school. When I first started on the Bell Rd Campus, we referred to it as PV Prison because of the tall, iron, spiked gates and security in golf carts patrolling the campus for potential escapees. I remember, before they briefly closed the campus for renovations, a girl falling through the auditorium wall, and pieces of the ceiling falling on peoples heads before they condemned it. After 2 years at this location, they suddenly closed the campus and opened the new campus on Union Hills, the campus that was to become North Canyon.
 They built the new campus with the intention of having both schools open, but as more and more buildings kept falling apart, they decided to shut down PV and re-open it under the same name on the new campus. 
 They spent a shit-ton fuck load of money on a super high-tech theater, in return for letting it be used for official Gov't events,  that no one new how to use. This was one of the best things about it. I was one of the few people who could run the sound and lights and got out of class frequently because of it. 
 I remember making a video with Casey about an art show the school was having and not being allowed to air it on the morning video announcements because we used the phrase ""come out of the closet"" and they thought the phrase might be offensive. Then, that same week, the football team had a video where they all pretended to be gay, talking with lisps and flailing limp wrists. When I went to the office to ask what the fuck, they told me that football players didn't need approval for anything they did. I remember my friend being expelled for missing too much school due to chicken pox and a mother not well enough to call her in. I, of course, seemed invisible to the system. I ditched class often, and it never showed on my record at all. I remember when Miss Lee dressed as a hard rocker with tattoo's for halloween and the administrators making her change it because the costume was a bad influence. I remember my friends boyfriend being suspended because they searched his car for drugs (on an anonymous tip) and found a box cutter in his trunk he used for work which he kept in his trunk because he went to work straight from school.  I remember testing out of highschool classes before freshman year, yet being subjected to 4 years of bullshit. I am pretty sure it was PVUSD that was the inspiration for the movie ""Pump Up the Volume"", which was filmed in the general area.
  When I quit the softball team, the coach/school councilor kept sending people to pull me out of class to try to talk me into playing again. When we took pictures for the badminton team, we didn't have enough uniforms for the entire team. 
 I felt like I was in some prison or some high security mental facility. In fact, when my mom visited the new campus, she was horrified there were no windows and they used the drab, grey/blue colors they use in mental hospitals she had worked in to keep the patients calm. I never had a chemistry class. My two history classes consisted of a teacher who spent one entire year talking about Shakespear, and another who said that ""The slaves did not have it so bad"".  My Biology book was so old, it had my friends mothers name in it from 20 years earlier, AND same friends mother warned me against my Biology teacher, Mr. H__. ""If he ever tells you to stay after class by yourself.. DON'T.""  
 
The Good Things I Remember -
 Mrs. Toal [sp?], a very good, and supportive, English teacher. Miss Lee, the best photography/video teacher ever and always had the best Halloween costumes. Hanging out at lunch under a tree with the boy we called Rico Suave who said he lived in a box and would tell stories about the Horny Lady. Sneaking off campus to go to Barrows Pizza. My friends  wearing cut out Trojan condom boxes pinned to their shirt at the forced ""spirit assemblies"" and chanting our own spirit chant of ""Fuck you all we hope you die, that's the Trojan battle cry"".

 Time has a way of blurring the past, and making it less icky. Yet, my sister is a teacher at North Canyon, and a few years back I went and visited her on campus. The second I stepped into the main building, I felt sick to my stomach. Literally.

The ingredients are spread out in a buffet. You go along the buffet and fill your bowl with whatever you like. I chose chicken, lots of veggies and rice noodles. The trick, from what I can tell is to shove as much food in your bowl and then using the handy wax paper they leave out for you, smash it down into your bowl so you can fit even more in! At the end of the buffet are tubs of different sauces and a chalkboard with  instructions for different combinations. I am a bit of a traditionalist and mixed up the Mongolian sauce. You then hand your embarrassingly heaping bowl to the cooks who quickly stir fry it for you and then hand it back.

Can I just say oh my God was this delicious without sounding vain because really I sort of cooked it myself? The ingredients were super fresh!

I live nearby, and am sad to see that a coffeeshop that sells coffee this horrible is still in business in my neighborhood.

Not only was the breve mocha that I ordered disgusting, so was the process of watching the barista make my drink.

They use hershey's chocolate from a dirty nacho cheese style pump with chocolate sauce dripping down the sides, and coagulated into a thick cap at the tip of the nozzle.  *Disgusting.  

The espresso shot was made without care, or concern for the fact that it was done way too quickly, and with espresso grounds that were ground way before I walked in the door.  Possibly way before the barista started her shift.   *Gross

And finally.  The milk.  She steamed the milk with the automatic steam wand.  This was a huge red flag.  Those are notorious for burning milk and making disgusting drinks.  Well, both were accomplished. 

The steam wand was tinted white from lack of cleaning.  And the worst part was that near the end of the wand was a DARK CHEESE that had accumulated from burning milk and not cleaning the wand after every use. 
Which is FREAKIN - DISGUSTING.

I wasted 5 bucks on an overpriced small mocha, and threw it away after taking a sip.

I ordered a travelzoo voucher for $69 that included 2 3 course meals. It said ""Regularly $140"". What we ordered, if had been ordered off the regular menu would have been about $100. However, we were charged tax on the full $140. 

Second, even though on the voucher it says ""PLEASE TIP ON THE FULL VALUE OF THE CHECK."" (which implies tip is not included and we get to choose the tip amount) and nowhere mentions automatic gratuity, 18% gratuity (18% of $140, even though we ordered $100 worth of food at the most) was automatically added to our check.

Third, even if you had ordered the most expensive options, the highest possible amount it could be worth is $120, not $140. It is mathematically impossible to have the voucher be a $140 value, but that is what they add tax and tip to.

Fourth, after we told our waiter we were using a voucher, he seemed less interested in the service level of our table, which i later realized was because he had a guaranteed 18% (of $140) tip.

"6305","LQAGqljDv0OefCFf236hzA","3","The food at Beaver Choice Scandinavian Bistro is delicious; a little unusual, but easily understood. Hearty and reasonably priced. You can find out all about it at azcentral.com in an article by Howard Seftel. Then, after reading this survival guide, you should go and try it.

     Things you will need:
 1. An afternoon or evening with no commitments other than your meal. This could take a long, long time.
 2. A pen and a piece of paper on which to write your order (along with an alternate choice).
 3. Dining companions who all enjoy the same foods and are willing to eat off the same plate.
 4. A snack to tide you over until your food arrives.
 5. A sense of humor (but try not to laugh out loud),

     Here's our experience:

     Four of us entered the small, 20 seat restaurant at 12:10. There were six other people seated at the minimalist glass top tables. A large, and very appetizing looking catering order was taking up another table. We were given menus and told to order at the counter. There were many, many choices of entrees (a few warned that they would take between 20 and 35 minutes to prepare - we avoided those), and each one came with a choice of four side dishes. You can see why a paper and pen might come in handy. Ken went to place our order, but he had to wait for three other people who had arrived before him. It took a while.  Then he was told that my entree choice was not available because they had run out of gravlax. I came up with another selection, and Ken went back to the counter - where another group of people had taken his place and were ordering. Another wait, then my second choice wasn't available either. The sauce had to be reduced and wouldn't be ready until Tuesday. I figured I'd be safe with a third choice of Swedish meatballs, so I yelled over to Ken who saw that each of our orders was being written on a separate piece of paper. Odd.

     We settled in to wait for our food. Our drinks were brought to the table. Sena's eyes popped when she sipped the pitch black coffee. The waitress said it was always that strong and that there was no milk or half and half available, but she could bring out some heavy cream. I noticed that food was coming out of the kitchen painfully slowly. One dish to one table, a while later, one dish to a different table. Companions were left twiddling their thumbs. It so reminded me of Hell's Kitchen - I could hear Gordon Ramsey going ballistic: ""Shut it down you &*#$%!!!!"" . At about 1 PM my Swedish Meatballs were delivered. I put the plate in the middle of the table and invited everybody to dig in. Luckily the servings are large. We finished that off and waited another ten minutes before Sena's chicken schnitzel arrived. That too was shared. At about 1:35 Ken's entree was brought. That left Leon, who had ordered Tilapia. We flagged down the owner and told her that we had a 2 PM engagement and would like our remaining dish. She said she'd look into it, went into the kitchen and was not seen again. A while later another staff member came over and told us that there had been a large catering order, that they had only a six burner stove  and that 2 employees had called in sick. I mentioned that I didn't think it was right to serve some people at a table and not others. ""This is the way we do it, we're not going to change it, and Howard Seftel thought it was all right"", was the emphatic reply. More waiting. At 1:50 a different staff member came over and said it would be a few more minutes. To our disconcerted rumblings he said - and you're not going to believe this - ""The fish has to be defrosted slowly because of the parasites....""  At this point, I'll confess, I started to laugh loudly and somewhat
hysterically. It may have been rude, but I couldn't help myself. 

     We were out of time, so Leon decided he'd take the fish to go. Ken went up to the counter and gave one of my Valley Vittles cards to the ""parasite"" staff member, saying that the food was great but the service terrible. At which point the staff member had a melt-down, yelled at Ken to get out of his restaurant, then went slamming through the kitchen kicking something on the way out.

Late last summer  I came home and was shocked to see two of my sunscreens looking quite vandalized. Upon further inspection, it appeared that while using a back mounted leaf blower, one of the landscape crew had brushed against them. The exhaust pipe must have ripped and burned the screen material as well. It was quite the nasty burned melted scar.

 After staring at it for several hours, I realized there was no virgin Mary, no Jesus, hell it just looked like burned grilled cheese without any deity or lesser apparitions whatsoever, regardless of the angle or my squint. So deciding there was no money to made on eBay, I set out to get them repaired.

Did some online searching and decided to call AmeriZona. I explained the situation and was told they could repair them, but I would have to bring them in. These are some pretty large sun screens mind you and packing them into the convertible would have been a challenge.

While pondering what to do the person helping me on the phone asked me if I could hold on. I could tell it was one of those thinking on your feet light bulb went off type can you hold requests.

She came back on the phone, informed me that she had a crew that was working close by and that she would ask one of the crew to swing by and pick up the screens for repair. She could not promise when they would be repaired, but for that convenience alone I was on board. She had already quoted me the price to repair the screens, and it was very reasonable considering some other online comparisons.

Someone showed up within a few hours to pick up the screens. He could not have been more accommodating, and it was obvious this guy had been working all day and was on his way home. 

A few days later, Mark  phoned me to tell me my screens were ready and to tell me he was going to drop them off on his way home! Needless to say Mark was also very pleasant to deal with. I believe he was at the time the sales manager. 

When he arrived, the screens looked great, matched the color of the others, even with the sun bleaching over several years. He even offered to put them in!

Good:  I can't get enough of the Cape Cod salad! It is really somethin' special, that ain't no lie.  Also the soup is always flavorful.

Bad: Has nothing to do with the food. It is all about the atmosphere, which is oppressive in an I'm-so-unique-and-talented-and-you-are-smelly-dung sort of way. Staff is pretentious and lazy. They think they must be pretty lofty individuals for working there but that doesn't mean they LIKE to work, for god's sake....  The owner. She is somewhat friendly, but beware.

She's still the kewlest of the kewl.

UPDATE: Received an annoying email from the owner (the husband) who instructed me give "" *constructive criticism* "" and not make a personal attack or be petty. My review was neither of those things. I do not know John, nor do I know Carla. I only know what I experience when I have lunch at their place of business. The staff was rude and lazy. The owner DID brag. The food I always order is good. Get a grip buddy.

I was honest about my experience for OTHER PEOPLE who are considering spending their cash on food there.  I am not in the least concerned about the owners or the staff personally, but apparently John thinks I ought to be.  I ought to see how great Carla is. In fact, he goes into detail about how great Carla is.  It's nice to witness a man standing up for his lady. It would almost cause me to add a star up there, but sorry, no can do.  His improper use of the possessive apostrophe SEVERAL times canceled that out (okay, now that was petty -my bad).  

I'd advise John to concentrate on things other than trolling around yelp, chastising his own customers, whose business supports that fancy paint and the famously zombie-like staff.  Maybe the staff is just following John's lead when they don't focus on creating a positive experience for their customers?

Honestly, I remain puzzled as to why John would bother to bother me.  I go into a small restaurant to find the owner bragging. That is part of my experience and I will continue to post reviews featuring owners, and how they carry themselves.

As for the ""personal attack"" on Carla, I will not retract what I said just because John is butthurt and whines about it. I will say this: Carla has probably been in the restaurant several of the many times I have dined there, but I perceived the bragging only one time. I doubt anyone who read my review would label this person a braggart based on that one experience of mine, and as I said before- it did not and would not stop me from going back.

Walking into the shop, its not much to look at-but what caught my eye is that is was CLEAN! Pristine to say the least-a nice change from most watch places that typically are cluttered with pieces as I think most watch/clock repair business's lean towards being hoarders :) 
It turns out the shop is under new ownership as of a few months ago (so give it another try Coda B.!) and the owner himself Eddie was upfront working on a piece.

I received the show only because it was from an outside source. The show was 2 hours long and by the time it was over half the restaurant I'd say 50 to 80 people still had not been served. They didn't have enough menu's for people to even order off of. Some guy in shorts walked around with buckets of silverware wiping them on his shorts then placing them on the table. The show started at 7:00, at 9:30 I still had no food. The people who did get food complained that it was terrible. Maybe I should be happy I didn't get any food. When I asked again about our order the waitress said she would take care of it. The guys in the kitchen were overheard saying ""f---k those people no more orders! not only did we not get the dinner we already paid for they flat out refused to give us dinner or our money back. We ended up at Dennys eating eggs at 11:00 . Seriously I've never had such a bad experience in my life.

First of all, I'd suggest making reservations otherwise DO NOT COME HERE. We showed up at 7pm but weren't seated until 845. Good thing we ate a really good lunch otherwise I'd be starving and complaining like a baby. At least this gave us time to have a few drinks before dinner in the LARGE outdoor waiting patio area.

It seems fun and they do have a large bar and waiting area. 

We ordered alligator and frog legs as an appetizer. LOVED IT!!! We wanted the fried alligator and frog legs but the waiter absolutely loved that he worked here and HIGHLY recommended that we order it grilled instead. Since he worked here, we figured why not? I was thinking to myself that the cooks were a bit lazy and maybe they didn't want to prepare it. Lol. To my surprise, it was good as he mentioned. I have had both before but not for a few years so I was pleased. My gf ordered the crab stuffed shrimp which was really good. I ordered a  combination seafood plate which was good but not great.

In my experience, the toppings area looked like it had all merged to become one big nest. There were also speckles and swipes of fro-yo in all places imaginable... floor, counters, scale... And, I wanted to try a couple flavors, but there was no one around to help. Also, the checkout lady was soooooo dreary! With her monotone listlessness, she made me feel as depressed as Sylvia Plath! (just kidding, but she couldn't have been more doldrums if she tried)

I usually go to Yogurtology at Town & Country mall (on Camelback just east of the 51). That place is always amazing... Pristine clean, neat, organized, always a peppy guy by the machines with little sampler cups, a guy who had one too many Red Bulls and is nearly throwing at least one sample of every single flavor at every single person who walks in the door, with a funny, witty little quip and a great personality and WAY too damn much energy. But it's nice.

THAT is what I had in mind when I discovered THIS place. I was excited. It was so much nearer to my house... great location (stupid layout though, prone to human traffic jams).

I really, really want to like Yogurtland, but I just can't talk myself into it. The fro-yo was good (aside from the fact that I had trouble getting toppings without being too grossed out since it was a mess), but that was about it.

On the day of the scheduled delivery, I got a call from the person I bought the pool table from, saying that Diamondback Billiards did not have my address or phone number and didn't know where to delivery the table (even though I was the one who set up the appointment and definitely gave my information during the phone call). So, I gave them my address, they showed up and set up and re-felted the pool table without incident. When I went to sign the invoice, I noticed that they even had my wrong last name on the invoice and had the seller's address listed as the Buyer and the Seller. I dont even know how this would happen except that the person I talked to when setting up the delivery was not doing his job. 

Also, I asked on the phone if they could bring an extra yard of fabric to cover a cue holder that I have and was told that it would not be a problem. And, you guessed it... the delivery guys knew nothing about it and didn't bring any. 

So, I went to the store the next week and asked if I could purchase a yard of the felt that they used to cover my table (I couldn't find a good color match at JoAnns). They told me that they would have to order it and it would cost $55. For a yard of felt.... yeah... that's nearly as much as I paid to have an 8 foot pool table covered.

I stood there for a couple of moments as I attempted to gingerly remove it, and thought the hose was stuck. I soon realized that I looked like an idiot, and just gave the vacuum a tug, and it came right out.

I had the egg salad sandwich (the croissant and egg salad was SO FRESH!!) with a side of potato salad was probably one of the top 3 potato salads I've ever had!

The salesman was nice and didn't provide too much pressure.

"6489","PIGkFtue69AiS_Kj9NlPeg","4","I like this store. It is not perfect, it is not a real farmer's market, but they have many things which other stores do not carry. 

First of all, their fresh sausages made from scratch daily are to die for. Even if you don't like the store overall, just go there, buy a few different sausages and grill them with 100% natural wood charcoal. (Please, do not use lighter fluid! Take a piece of bounty, soak it in some cheap olive oil and you will ignite anything)
If you see 15 different kinds of sausage and don't know which one you may like, ask for their sausage menu; there is a description and list of all ingredients.

Then lets go to their meat department. Grass fed meet. It is not something you will see at any regular store. Is it good? It is worth extra? I'm a skeptic, but I found it to be way better than a regular meat.  Grass fed ground beef was so good! We made burgers and I could definitely taste the difference. 
Grass fed filet mignon was also very nice. It was not better than USDA prime filet mignon from Costco, but it was way better than regular corn fed  filet mignon. I wish farmers would go back to the old times, when they were not controlled by 5 corporations and nobody was forcing cows to eat corn, but I digress...

Need real organic eggs and willing to pay $5 per dozen? No problem, they are here. Frankly, I could not tell that these organic eggs were way better than regular eggs for half the price, but maybe people who bake can tell the difference...

Also, if you're looking for that particular brand of sour cream, butter, kefir  (lowfat yogurt), most likely, you will find it there - they carry many different brands and it seems they do not favor one over another. 

Try organic bananas and tell me they taste the same as regular ones. They do not, they are way better, they have flavor and they are sweet. They almost taste like bananas you would get on Caribbean islands. The one they sell to you the same day they take it off the tree... when it was already yellow and ripe Try peaches and apricots from Chile. They taste like peaches and apricots. Yes, some will have marks, dents and will not look perfect, you have to select, but I rather spend 3 extra minutes picking good ones than get tasteless, but all perfectly looking fruits.

Now, bad. Of course, they do not always have best fruits and vegetables and a lot of them have a tag ""Mexico"". It is unfortunate that ""grown in Mexico"" is associated with poor produce nowadays. Mexico has a great climate and they can definitely grow tasty, pesticide free fruits and vegetables. Unfortunately, the market drives demand in a capitalist economy. Many people still look for huge and cheap. Companies provide huge and cheap. Some people are poor, they don't have money to buy quality produce and overpay for organic.  It is sad, but unless we stop buying crappy produce, organic will be super expensive for a while (no competition).

These huge see through plastic bins filled with different nuts seems like a great idea at first, but way too unsanitary. People open these bins with their dirty hands, dip into them, cough and sneeze next to them and that's where you get your nuts from? No way! At least, not for me.

Fish section looks sad, which seems to be a trend in every AZ supermarket. You can find better fish in our area at Costo (huge amounts, good for big families), sometimes AJs (not always though), Mekong plaza supermarket or Lee Lee Oriental Supermarket. That's it.  if you know any other places where I can get fish which does not smell fishy, please let me know.

A lot of their organic produce, including potato is wrapped with a sticky label which says organic on every item. Ughh... it was so annoying to remove wrap around labels from every potato that at the end I didn't not care for the taste - I just wanted to finish peeling them. I guess, the store has to identify organic food somehow, but these extremely sticky labels are not a good idea. Think of something else, Sprout.

The veggie rolls were tasty and larger than we're used to, which was a nice surprise. The Tom Ka soup was a little more sour than we're used to, but overall still tasty. However, it was almost $11 which we felt was about double what it should have cost. The Pad See-ew was the most disappointing part of the meal. The flavor was fine, nothing special but not bad. However, it was pretty dry and sticky, like you'd expect from a cheap college Thai take-out joint.

Fried Chicken and Fried Cod, they keep their fries clean and use a great breading recipe,  try it you'll be back for more.

mixers,
not the biggest fan but they hit the spot when you need to.  be creative and make your own mixer.  

Service,
well its ok, they do bring it to your table and when you do a drive thru don't expect this to be Wendy's, it will take some time depending on what you order.  Your given a number and a nice high school student will bring some food to you.
The service seems to be young here, they just like hiring someone looking for their 1st job or so.

Tanked Fish to the rescue! I will now drive the irritating 15+ miles out of my way to eat here on a weeknight, whenever he can break free from his wife and two cute little kids (he wouldn't approve of the way I word that, for the record). 

I'm concerned that the high ratings this place has gotten so far will lead to false expectations. I love Tanked Fish for two very simple reasons: I always have a great time, and I always stuff my face with sushi until I can eat no more. One night we came here, ate more sushi than we needed to, had a large beer or two, and the bill for all of this... two of us... came to TWENTY SIX DOLLARS. I'm sorry folks but there are very few places on earth where this is possible. [Note: This was during a weeknight happy hour special]

A snooty sushi connaisseur would probably tell you that something is wrong with the quality of the sushi. I can't. It tastes good. It has some large tables and would be a great place to bring a large group (6-8 people).

Aiello's is in a beautiful building.  I don't think a building has ever detracted from my eating experience, but in case's like Aiello's, the wonderful shaded, verdant patio set the mood in all the right ways.

The food was awesome.  Delicious, probably house-made pasta with simple flavors that let the sauces and vegetables sing.  An exhaustive - but not daunting - wine list - though it'd be nice to see more options served by-the-glass.

As icing on the cake, at the end of the meal, you get to play a game that might let you get your meal for free.  I won't ruin the surprise, but it adds a lot of character.

My mom says that she ate nachos w/ jalepenos on a regular basis while pregnant with me.  Maybe that explains it.  Anyway, I've been wanting to try this place forever since they claim to have ""the best tortillas in town.""  I seized the opportunity to check it out since I had to drop a friend off at the airport this morning.   

The exterior certainly leaves a lot to be desired, and the ambiance is about on par with the drunk tank at the fourth avenue jail (a good friend spent a most unfortunate night here and described it in detail).  The cold, stained cement floors, nasty old booths and 70's McDonald's style swivel plastic chairs which likely  needed a new coat of paint back in the early 80's.  I decided on a green chile burrito and my companion ordered the egg/chorizo/potato/cheese burrito.  After waiting for about 5-10 minutes, our number was called.  The first thing I noticed was that the burritos were quite small.   I knew, however, that I was in for a real treat with the piping hot, super chewy freshly made tortilla, and I was not disappointed.  The green chile, while tasty, had too much liquid and after inadvertantly puncturing my tortilla, I was left with a handful of sauce.  

I certainly felt more than safe inside this place (despite the somewhat scary clientele) based on the table of twelve Phoenix police officers sitting across from us.  Overall, I would give the atmosphere 1.5 stars, and the food 3.75 stars.

"6634","4WqC6X-pmTr7sUs_puPd-w","3","Slices or Spinato's? When you're near Tempe Marketplace and don't want to miss the movie you are about to watch you should check this place out. Slices is more of a ""New York"" style pizza where as Spinato's is more of a homemade style pizza, and I don't say that with any disrespect. In fact, if I had to suggest one of the two places I would most definitely suggest Spinato's. I'll try outline my reasoning behind this choice.

Slices just has their ""NY"" style pizza, and to be quite honest they don't even do it that well. There are tons of places in Phoenix that do ""NY"" style pizza, and a notable place is Venezia's on Southern and Mill, not too far from Tempe Marketplace. Spinato's does have an ""NY"" style pizza and a Sicilian pizza, and the latter is actually pretty good.

On a Friday night, this place gets somewhat packed for dine-in, but you can order ""eat-in"". So basically, you order you food, wait to be seated, and then shortly after being seated you can get your food. This worked out pretty well. The service is also good, and the staff are pretty friendly. Bathroom was small, one bathroom for the whole place, but it was clean and well kept. 

The pizza was very interesting, we got a Sicilian ""Traditional Vegetarian"" pizza. Essentially, if you could compare it to another pizza it'd be DiGiorno. Seriously though, the pizza reminded me a lot of DiGiorno's frozen pizza. This place has a unique homemade feeling to it, and even the pizza. I'm not saying its bad, its just unique. The crust is actually delicious, and I usually don't care too much about the taste of the crust, but this one actually tasted pretty good. The downside though is the way they served it, nothing to pick up slices with, and it was super easy for toppings to slide through the grill when it was warm. It became somewhat of a pain to handle the first few slices. 

This place has serious selection issues. Let's see, pork, pork, more pork, and a little bit more pork, oh and a little bit of vegetarian stuff. Ok, so where does that leave kosher meat eaters? Not at this place. If you eat kosher meat, and enjoy it on your pizza, this is not the place to come. There is literally no chicken or beef available here in terms of toppings.

This place is pretty good and moderately priced. My significant other and I shared a 14"" sicilian, and got waters which totaled to something like $15. Certainly not a terrible price, but for the price I think we could do a little better. I suppose if we wanna catch a movie after dinner we would visit this place, but it is certainly isn't on the top of our pizza visiting list.

"6651","z5QUoLi0VLMDeQR_6x2UqA","4","Nice views of South Mountain, lots of elevation changes and some tricky par 3's make this a very solid muni and probably the toughest in town.  

First my two complaints: the chipping area should have a few more holes with a slightly larger green, and the neighborhood is atrocious.  

Aguila has four features not often found at municipal golf courses:
1) You need to drive the ball well to score well here.  From a lot the tee boxes, the driving area often looks smaller than it is; so, confidence with the big stick is key.  
2) Absence of generous flat lies in the fairway; even if you drive the ball well, you are not always rewarded and are sometimes faced with side-hill lies.  
3) Very tough holes #9 and #18.  Hey, I like to score low as much as the next guy, but the thing about city courses is that they often give you easy closing holes with a good birdie chance; NOT the case here.  Rated 3 and 2 handicaps respectably, #9 and #18 take advantage of the same water hazard (similar to the closing holes at Karsten @ ASU) and put in play some penal, deep fairway bunkers that require precision drives and good approach shots.  #18 plays 470 yds+ from the tips, so if you hit a bomb, you still don't have a wedge in your hand.  
4) Two true risk / reward par 4's - both with water, both greens are drivable from the tee.  #8 is not a guaranteed birdie from the greenside bunkers, but they're a good bailout.  #17 is longer and is a slightly more daunting drive with a more generous bailout option to the right, these are great holes.

A tip: 
Take advantage of the par 5's; all but the last one is reachable in two (at least, that's been my experience).  There are only two par 3's that I would consider good birdie chances (#13 and #16), so if you can roll in a few putts, you're set.

If you are looking for a vet that is COMPETENT, a vet that REALLY CARES about animals and a vet that is INEXPENSIVE and reasonably priced, then you really have to check out Dr. Howard at Grayhawk Animal Hospital in North Scottsdale. He is worth the trip.

I am so impressed by Dr. Howard and his EXCEPTIONAL STAFF. Every time we come here we leave satisfied beyond our expectations. 

Since my last review, we have used them two more times. Once when Spencer got neutered, and once when he had to have his nails trimmed. I have to say I am so very impressed. I was holding back on reviewing them again until I could be certain that it would be an accurate review and to be certain that they are consistent with their outstanding service and pricing. Well, I can say confidently now that they most certainly are.

Spencer was neutered here some time ago with no complications and no outrageous fees. When he was done his procedure, I received a happy, completely alert dog back from them. His incision was minimal, the sutures were tight and he healed quickly. It was done so well that he did not even lick at the area. It was like nothing ever happened.

More recently, Spencer needed his nails trimmed, and because he was a rescued dog from a very abusive situation, he does not trust people and has a phobia to anyone touching his tail or feet. It is so bad that when I try to nicely, calmly approach him to trim his nails, he urinates all over himself and hides for the rest of the day. Spencer was really abused and as a result, grooming is really difficult.

Well, I discussed this with the doctor's office and we decided that sedation (unfortunately) was our only option. His nails were getting too long and painful and something needed to be done. Well, we just got him back from the office and they were so good about it that they did not even have to sedate him. I am impressed, but what I am more impressed with is that they first tried to trim his nails without using sedation and had his best interest in mind. They really care about the animals they treat. 

They could have sedated him. It would have been quicker and easier and more profitable for them, but they didn't. They really did not want to use a drug on him if they did not have to - and so they didn't. They trimmed his nails up well and did not even cut into the quick or make him bleed. He left there, again and as usual, a happy, well taken care of dog. And we left there ecstatic! The bill was so inexpensive and Spencer was taken care of so well - like he was their dog. I just can't say enough good things about this Veterinary Office. 

I think that everyone knows that good medical professionals are hard to find - for humans and/or animals. So often, they just don't care about the patient. Well, not here. It appears to be their top priority. Dr. Howard is a very happy, well educated man and it shows in his practice in every way - right down to all of the people he hires (they are all equally happy and competent!). You will not be disappointed if you go here. They are honest and kind and not out to rip you off or get as much money from you as they can. They are truly exceptional. So if you need honest, competent & friendly care at very affordable prices, you owe it to yourself and your pet to make the trip over to see Dr. Howard at Grayhawk animal hospital. You will be in good hands! You will save money, and you won't be disappointed in the least.

They are truly exceptional, but that is the end result of really caring, really liking your profession and really knowing what you are doing... And we love them for it!",5,6,2,19.5,"Positive","5"

It's like a mini-vacation every time you go.  Part beach bar, part pseudo-tiki (any place that has thatch palm fronds above the bar gets a star in my book!), you'll feel like you're on a beach somewhere every time you visit.  
It's nice to have one within walking distance to the office, to allow for a little exercise to and from and still have a good meal.  Their prices are reasonable.  I've been struggling to find a lunch under $10 these days, and the Tri-tip sandwich and an iced tea will set you back a ten spot and some change.  The food is good, did I mention that?  The staff is friendly, and they finally did away with the cheap-o' paper towels and put real napkin dispensers on each table...FTW!  
There's an unlimited chips and salsa bar, I like the cabo sauce the best for my chips.  I always add a little Baja sauce; you have to ask for it at the counter, to whatever I'm enjoying.  Today it happened to be the Tri-tip sandwich.  I give it 4 out of 5 stars because even though they have to-go cups, this is Phoenix.  It is 108* outside and the full glass of iced tea I left the restaurant with was gone by the time I got back to the office.  There should be a City-wide ordinance that all restaurants must supply patrons with at least a 32 oz. to-go cup during working hours.  All right, I confess that might be a little much.  The only down-side to Chuy's at lunch I've found so far is having to go back to work afterwards and not being able to enjoy a Corona with my lunch.  That's okay though, it just one more reason to go back.",4,2,3,7,"Positive","5"

Good selection of well-executed dim sum when the carts actually come around and there's anything left in it.  I'd give it 4 stars for food but the wait definitely detracted from the whole experience.

I think the problem with Golden Buddha is that they can't handle the heavy flow on weekends.  There's not enough regular dim sum eaters like LA that can sustain a steady flow of diners throughout the week, forcing restaurants like Golden Buddha to depend heavily on extra part-time help on weekends.  

Dim sum takes serious skill so the chef still ends up doing most of the work.  When we looked into the kitchen, we saw a Chinese woman doing most of the cooking herself.  No wonder it took forever for a cart to come out and when it does, it's swarmed on by a pack of vultures.

If you're willing to eat at a more simply decorated place with a smaller menu, I'd highly recommend China Chan.  It's much more relaxed - usually no wait on weekends.  An experienced chef makes all the dim sum himself so the menu's much shorter but all the classics are on it.  Anything steamed is made to order so is very fresh.",0,1,1,2.5,"Positive","5"

I love the packaging - the deep purple and brown on the box and wrapper. After devouring my first brownie, I was an instant fan.

When we were leaving, though, the line was easily an hour long.

We started with the wings, which come in an order of 14 and were delicious.  Five of us were dining there, so we ordered two small pizzas, with each one being a half, so we had a nice variety of pizzas to try from.  We got the BBQ Chicken, the Frisco, Grandma G's, and one more that eludes me now.

I was told they are very picky about reservations and, if your party isn't complete, no table. So our 6pm reservation was now in jeopardy because the last two of us (me and my fiance) were running late due to issues on the ramp at Sky Harbor airport, obviously out of our control. But they still didn't want to seat us...  additionally, I overhead on the way to the place that they would only ""try"" to do their best to accommodate our party, making it sound like they were booked up solid until closing....typical Scottsdale always trying to look more happening and hot than it really is. 

Moving on, we somehow ""lucked out"" (go figure) and had a table no problem, so all the stress caused by the hostess was unnecessary and, in my opinion, pretty unprofessional, especially since the restaurant was empty by 8pm, again, typical Scottsdale. 

The menu was brief, and I almost had to double check I wasn't looking at an appetizer. Most of the items are typical Mexican staples with a bit of a Southwestern American twist to them making the food a hit or miss if you ask me, some items were good, some were not. But that's really anywhere I suppose. 

The one thing that stood out for me was the Guac. I will say this was flat out delicious but Guac is pretty had to screw up. 

The margaritas in my opinion reminded me of something you'd get more at Chilis, a little too sweet for my liking but definitely drinkable.

The sandwich I got this weekend was very bland and somewhat disappointing in portion size I've grown accustom to at the ""WBC"" and they've discontinued making their bread salad.

I received an apology letter from the founder and an offer to refund my money.  I don't need a refund... this is not what Yelp is about, but it was really refreshing to know that a company still cares about their customers reviews.  After re reading my review it may have sounded worse than my experience actually was.  The sandwich I got was a new one from their menu named the Spicy Chipotle Egg Sandwich, it was good but I like SPICY!!!  I may order it again and just ask for an extra egg and some more chipotle sauce.  The gentleman did give me the recipe for the salad that I've enjoyed in the past.

It is 4 stories high, shaped like a football and stadium, with huge billboards facing into the 2 water fountains, its only redeeming value.

It is populated with typical Scottsdale type restaurants....Big on decor, small on taste, with chain restaurants peddling Chef/Designer highly stacked fusion flavors masking average casual food for a larger tab per serving. 

Even the hords of young, large bossomed hostesses, bartenders and waitresses in black t-shirts are the attractions that were first ubiquitous in Scottsdale, then downtown Phoenix around the Diamondback Stadium, has now moved to the west side of the Valley! Margarittaville, Johnny Rockets, Fox Sports Grill, Kabuki Japanese...all formula chains for the average masses who think they are getting something special, but aren't. 

Meanwhile, the Superbowl early this year, the reason why this complex was completed (and for the new football Stadium) has come and gone, the housing boom has collapsed, and the westside house prices have dropped 30 - 40%. Consequently, within a couple of blocks, the luxury condos are being auctioned off, the Westgate Offices atop the stores are empty, and so are the new office buildings. 
The anchor Hotel the Renassaince, also a Westin of Kierland  poser, is nicely lit but largely empty. There is a conference center attached, so it might get some occupancy other than Football season weekends, but the Homewood Suites nearby has got to be a summer bargain hotel.

This is classic Valley gaudiness at its worst. And it is set conveniently off the Loop 101 at Glendale Road near the Agua Fria riverbed, but otherwise it is a vast open field of former farm land.

So we head there for lunch today.

Now, I know this about Korean food...I ate kimchi made by the mother of one of my daughters friends and it was good. Beyond that, I know that when I flip on LPGA on television to watch the hottee Paula Creamer, some Korean chick is depriving her of a victory and I am none too pleased but it does appear that they understand food...but I digress.

Lunch specials $ 4.95 - OK...I'm suspicious. Includes 3 pieces of california roll, salad, rice, vegetable and entree. Too cheap. 

We order gyoza and egg roll appetizers. Evidently gyoza in Korean restaurant is different than Chinese restaurant but is scrumptious nonetheless. Egg rolls more typical to my expectations and very tasty - I'm optimistic. Tea is in big weird cup with no handle and waaay too hot to actually pick up but tea bag says Liptons...I'm still suspicious.

Salad, underwhelming but I am impressed with silver chopsticks that work well for me.

Comes the lunch platter...
- California Rolls, AOK 
- big mound of white rice, perfect
- pickled vegables, tasty and interesting
- sweet/sour vegetables, tasty and interesting...wishing someone could tell me what it was I was eating but hey, it's all good.
- meat (I had bbq pork but forget the name) mildly spiced, nice, a little dry but that may have been intentional...my knowledge of Korean clearly fails me here. 2nd dad got bbq beef and it was very tasty, not spicy, much more moist.

My husband was surprised that I ordered this, since I don't like mushrooms, and luckily for me, the extent of the mushrooms were some medium ones in the sauce. The gnocchi were very tender and the sauce was rich and creamy. I felt like I was eating a delicious mac & cheese with some soft foccaccia bread. OMG. We also ordered the porteguese style mussels that were a fave of my husband's. They were just okay to me but overall, were decent.

It is one of the few parks in the valley that isn't completely surrounded by development, at the top are beautiful fields and you notice the fauna change. There is also water in huge white stone natural catchment areas, hence the name ""White Tanks""

It is so far from most home development and completly in the wrong direction to support any kind of ""Green"" living and combining activities as most people do when they visit a public institution such as finding a place to eat lunch, a store to check out, or to mail a letter.

   I think Jason B.'s comments most accurately mirror my overall feel for this place. And, while I find Nick S.'s opinions undeservedly harsh, they do contain kernels of truth that shouldn't be entirely dismissed either.
   Regarding cleanliness: I contend that Tony's operates on the ""European Standard"". So ,if you've ever been, you know. If your home has anti-bacterial soap pumps at every sink, you carry antiseptic wipes in your purse or on your person at all times, and you fixate on the illusion of a 100% microbe-free world, you may want to ""pass"" on visiting Tony's. I'd assume then, that you would also avoid any contact with street vendors and food stalls in places like Mexico, Madrid, Bangkok, Hong Kong, et al? Yeah, we're all free to set limits on our individual tolerances, but at what cost to the fullest enjoyment of all that our one, single, lifetime has to offer? Scorpions on a stick, anyone? Perhaps a chilled brewski for starters. Do you do calamari, or not?
   If you're of the more adventurous sort, at least poke your nose into Tony's for the cultural experience. I consider this place a bona-fide living history museum, with a least three generations of family in evidence, and at your service. Want the lights on in the grocery? Ask. Have a question about ANYTHING? Ditto.
   Also, take time to see the mementos, memorabilia, kitsch, and exotic products liberally displayed on,behind ,and above the counter and entry. Yeah, there IS dust, but for me that doesn't diminish the faded, festive charm in the least. Nor does it alter the palpable sense of eras past, and present, that this place evokes in me. See the vintage ('50's?) black and white photo of Elvis w/some past friend or relation. Or, more currently, the color shot of, and shout out from, the entire Orangewood Cheer Squad of '09.
   I admit that not everything at Tony's is superfine, or to everyone's particular taste. I don't especially care for the coarse grind of their sausage, for example, but the sliced meats and cheeses are very good, and well priced. I WOULD recommend checking expire dates on groceries, since the turnover on these items is unknown. I've found outdated items at AJ's, Fry's, and  almost everywhere else.  It happens.
   If you're up for a purchase, let you senses (and common sense) be your guide. I ""second"" the votes for the subs, and the standard size, traditional cannoli @$2.15 is a bargain. (compared to $7 at Aiello's restaurant on Central, which I haven't tried.)
   Another bargain here is the bulk olives. While I'm not a big fan of green or kalamata types by themselves, a good tapenade is always welcome. With jumbo plain greens @$3.50lb., and Greeks priced at the upper end of $5.49lb., you can pay $11 and up for the same thing elsewhere. Let the Snoot in you decide.

   To wrap, YOU NEED TO KNOW about their SICILIAN olives.
They're black. They're ripe. They're wrinkled, and dry-cured, and shiny. They're salty,(very) not sour. They're earthy, deeply rich, and complex. They're meaty, satisfying, and delicious. They're addicting. They're sprinkled with fennel seed, red pepper flakes, and (on a good day) bits of fresh garlic. They conjure Mediterranean breezes, raven-haired maidens in aprons, and hillsides with goats. They're seaspray and sunshine; they're sublime. And they're $4.49. Match with a favorite wine, a crusty loaf, a chunk of cheese, and you're home.. Where the heart is... OR, you can eat them like candy. Try at least ONE in your lifetime.
   Sadly, Tony's skips the minced garlic more often than not. If your purchase comes without, I strongly encourage you to add your own at home. Makes a world of difference.",0,1,0,5,"Positive","5"

I typically don't think of salads as memorable dishes but this is by far the best salad I have ever had and I would come back just for the chopped salad.

The food is authentic. They use the white Mexican cheese is used in Mexico. In Mexico cheddar cheese is not used on top of tacos or tostadas. Prices are very affordable. The ladies that take your order at the front desk had been there for at least 10 years and are very kind. 

Restrooms are always clean and this is so important to me. If a restaurant does not have the time to maintain its restrooms clean then I can not trust them in the food being clean.

The cons......BRING CASH! no credit cards are accepted. Also, they do not have the best control over flies. I always have a fly somewhere around my table. I think it has to be with no AC.

Our initial impression of the place was that it was going to be too rich for our blood; however, we figured we would give it a shot. The decor reminded my boyfriend of nightclub scene from Scarface. 

When they sat us down initially we were right next to the kitchen which wasn't too pleasant. So we asked to be moved to another location and the hostess moved us into their private dinning room which we loved. 

Our server was very friendly and informative, yet also gave us space. We ordered crab cakes to start things off. They were excellent but slightly over priced given the portion size. Then we ordered a bottle of wine that was very reasonably priced and to our liking for $24 - a nice Argentinian Malbec. We decided on this bottle after our server brought us several other tastes. I ordered the soup of the day and my boyfriend got a caesar salad. Both were solid. For entrees I got a salmon with asparagus and my boyfriend ordered seared ahi tuna. Both were cooked to perfection.

I was VERY impressed by their beer list! They had the biggest beer selection I've seen anywhere. When I was shopping at a specialty store last week, I noticed a ""Maui Brewing Co. Coconut Porter"" that l was very curious to try - but I passed it up because it was $10 for a 4-pack (ouch). I asked the bartender at Boulders (Rob) if they happened to have that specific beer - and to my utter surprise they did! I was happy I was able to try it out before shelling out ten bucks to buy a four pack at the store. Two thumbs up! 

Speaking of Rob the bartender, he was great. Very fast to take care of all the customers around us as well as my boyfriend and I. Made sure we had everything we needed without being intrusive. 

Overall, I had a really good first experience at Boulders on Broadway, and I will definitely be back. I dug the old-school ambiance with the wood paneled bar, we received very good service, and the selection of beer was amazing - truly something for everyone.

ABOUT THE AUTHOR-INTERESTING BACKGROUND

My first endeavor was a rolerblade marathon in tucson in 2004.  I guess it's out of style now so no more skates.  Used to do the New TImes 10k in phoenix every year too.  GONE, sad.

Last year I did the Tour de Phoenix 72 mile bike race on a 33lb. full suspension (no lockouts) mountain bike with slime in both tires and all my supplies on my bike and camelback... thought i was tough, 'till I tried running!  Injuries were now a new thing now and it is much tougher per hour than biking, but about the same calorie burn... Still love both. I did a sprint triathlon recently too.

We all know running is 'hard' you don't get extra calorie burn from impact stress but something about running and especially in this event captured my interest.  On the way to the zoo last year i saw the half marathon pass by and said ""I think i could do that NOW"" boy was i wrong... it took me almost a year to train for this event, but what a worthwhile challenge.  

I did this as a run walk 3 min run 1 min walk.  I learned from the Galloway training method that this method is not only easier but faster than trying to run straight through.  .I am capable of the constant run for this time but it winds up being slower than when i take walk breaks. I tested this with a 10k distance. I was 7 minutes faster with a run walk than running straight through.  look it up, may change your life too.

The eggs were perfectly cooked and the green salsa had a great kick.

Unlike other Korean restaurants, their lunch special selection is very limited. Special A  consists of a sushi roll with a soda, special B = teriyaki beef/chicken (no soda), or special C, Korean BBQ Spicy Chicken. 

As we were looking at the ""lunch special"" board, the lady behind the counter insisted that we should look at their full price menu instead. Here comes the awkward part: she then asked my mom ""are you Chinese?"" Even though she is, my mum looked at me all puzzled as in ""what does that mean?"" The lady proceeded by pointing at the ""seafood pancake"" section on the menu and saying ""I don't know why but you Chinese like this pancake a lot."" Good thing my mom didn't hear what she said.. or else... 

So we got the Spicy Chicken lunch special ($6.99), a bulgogi ($6.99), and a beef yakisoba ($7.19). The cool thing about this place is that it has a mini ""kimchi"" buffet bar, with trays of marinated tofu, potato, bean sprout, kimchi, broccoli and some other vegetables. It also has this delicious house special hot sauce. 

By the time we finished a dish of kimchi, the food came, so it didn't take long. The spicy chicken, came in a bowl about the size of an instant-noodle bowl (but slightly deeper), was tender, with rice underneath it. The chicken was definitely marinated well; however, the last couple of pieces had tendons and big chunks of fat... what a bad way to end it. The bulgogi also came in a bowl, with rice underneath. The beef was definitely not marinated fully. The color was super light and the beef was close to tasteless. The biggest disappointment, food-wise, was the beef yakisoba. The noodles, occupying most of the Styrofoam lunch box, were sweet. Then there was an ice-cream scoop of rice, topped with 3 pieces, I kid you not, THREE pieces of dog-tag-sized, super-dry meat. 

In the end, we just decided to bring the barely-touched yakisoba home for my younger brother (well, teenage boys tend to eat everything...). While my mom transfered the noodles to the plastic bowl (since the Styrofoam box was lidless), I went to ask for a plastic cover. This is the best part: the same lady, stared at me, pointed at the salad bar and said ""you can't take that home"". I thought there was a miscommunication, so I asked again for a lid for the noodles. Again, she pointed at the salad bar and said ""you are not allowed to take the kimchi home"". Wow seriously? Just b/c my grandparents are Chinese you assumed we were stashing kimchi in a bowl and trying to sneak it out? ""Look, I just want to take my noodles home, ok?"" She hesitantly gave me a lid.

""Hey, hey you. we chineness peple no steal kimchi becuz Confucius say 'no stealing kimchi'""... only if I said that to her face...

Oh, and when we got home, my brother, aka our food dumpster, took a bite of the yakisoba and never touched it again.

"7058","uWOai947MVYIhiQGstsdhQ","5","Just fantastic. I first went to Cornish Pasty in 05' a few months after they opened and fell in love immediately. Although a few things have changed over the years each one is usually an improvement and never a negative. 

If you are not familiar, a pasty is a traditional British coal miners food.  A hearty filling wrapped in a pie crust and baked. Kind of a hand-held meat pie. Cornish Pasty Co. has taken this simple and traditional dish and meticulously perfected each component. Their crusts are some how simultaneously hearty and flaky. Although their is nothing delicate about their seasoning it is never out of balance and all of the ingredients are always quality. 

Beyond just mastering the finer details of pasty science, Cornish Pasty Co. has also branched off into wild and exotic flavors. It's no shocker that the British know Indian food and it shows with the tika masala and the lamb vindaloo pasties. What is shocking is the refinement of the Greek and Italian inspired pasties. Perhaps my favorite pasty, from the cuisine most elusive to the British, is the Carne Avadado. This is a Mexican inspired pasty that will satisfy even the most snobby Las Cruses/El Paso foodie. If you have ever talked Mexican food with one you will know just what I mean. 

I have eaten nearly every item on the menu and not a one disappoints. It took me ages to get past the pasties and start ordering soups and salads. Now that I have had the spinach, mushroom, walnut soup, it is hart to save room for my old favorites. 

Although the mine shaft inspired interior is dark and cramped I have never felt uncomfortable there. The sound system is usually bumping classic rock and the employees are pierced and tattooed well beyond your typical wait staff, but everyone is friendly and service is typically good.

If I have to list a negative the only one I can think of is the food is consistently just a little better at the University location than the Dobson one.  No clue why, but everyone I've talk to seems to agree, the Tempe store has the edge on quality.

Our table was ready right on time and we had an awesome waitress who gave great suggestions on ordering... there were so many good looking options on their restaurant week menu. We're sharers, so we ordered with that in mind. 

Drinks: 
We got the pomegranate mojito (very refreshing) and a peach-blood orange mojito (sweet, but very good)

Starters: 
Signature empanadas: Tasty. The focus was the meat, I would have preferred more vegetables inside.
Sauteed prawns: The star here were the sauces - delicious!

Entrees: 
Cola Braised Short Ribs: AMAZING! Some of the best we've ever had. The short ribs were very tender and not fatty at all. The flavor was so good!
Pernil Asado (shredded pork): So delicious!! I made little tacos with their fresh corn tortillas. 

Sides: 
Green chili cornbread casserole: A little drier than I had imagined, but great flavor. 
Maple chiliglazed carrots: The glaze didn't really stand out to me, but good as far as baby carrots go.
Jalapeno creamed corn: I was pleasantly surprised - really enjoyed this one! 
Chipotle cheddar mashed potatoes: A great side with the short rib. 

Dessert: (By this point, we knew we'd need to be rolled out of the restaurant, but we HAD to have dessert since it was part of restaurant week). 
Chocolate chip bread pudding: Really good chocolate chip bread with scoops of malted chocolate crisp ice cream. This was a lot of food after that meal, but I savored the bites I had. The ice cream was excellent!

I'm a local Phoenician who resides in the Arcadia neighborhood and frequents many of the wonderful restaurants and hotels this City has to offer.  After hearing MANY negative reviews from co-workers, family, and friends, my fiancé and I decided to give the W Hotel Scottsdale a shot prior to forming an opinion of our own for this hotel/restaurant/bar.

During a night out on the town with visiting and local friends, we opted to give this place a try.  Upon approaching the entrance of the bar, security tells us that we're not welcome here due to one of the members of our party not having closed toe shoes and another not having a collared shirt.  The attire our group was wearing was more than appropriate for any Phoenix/Scottsdale restaurant/bar.  Let me remind you that's is July in Phoenix, and over one-hundred degrees at the time of night we went to the W and the six of us just finished a dinner at an adjacent, popular restaurant.  The staff was flat out rude to not only us, but others in line wanting and willing to spend money and support the local hotel.

I will strongly suggest not staying here or supporting the quality of business they are running here.  During a time of a slowing economy and tourism, many businesses are forced to rely solely on the best possible customer service to attract and retain business--the W Hotel fell way short of this.

There's a gimmicky hot-rock appetizer where you cook pieces of steak on a super hot rock.  It's way too expensive for what little meat you get, but it's an awful lot of fun.

The service is excellent as well, though maybe a little too servile for my tastes.  The wait staff go WAY out of their way to make you comfortable and quickly take care of any needs.  I just don't care for all of the introductions - I'm not going to remember the names of the 4 or 5 people bringing me stuff.  Still, I think that's the Scottsdale influence.  Not bad, but not really my thing.

Overall, I've enjoyed both of the meals that I ate at Taneko, but with better places to eat real Japanese food like Yasu, Sea Saw, Hiro's and even Sakana, I'm probably not going back real soon.",1,2,1,2.5,"Positive","4"

First off, the food was okay.  I ordered some chicken wings, which wasn't really that great.  My favorite was the Thai Curry -- it definitely had some pop to it.  It's one of those that creep up on you.  Milk please!  My friend ordered some Sake that I thought was real good and smooth -- don't ask me what it was, the lighting was low and I didn't care much by the time I arrived.

Curb Appeal: Strip mall Bar and Tavern; Clean entrance, no major issues. Big tinted windows on the side facing Elliot to keep the sun out; the front looks like strip club (not a bad thing, just sayin'); It has glass block windows and a solid oak door. 

Layout: Cool layout; right side is a large dining room with good amount of tables and some booths. Off to the left of the entrance is a large ""U"" shaped bar with plenty of high top tables surrounding it. On the dining level there are numerous booths and table tops. 

Ambiance: VERY clean, noticed that a table stayed unbussed for only a few seconds before it was taken care of. Good sound system, lots of TV's showing variety of sports. I can only vouch for the Mens room, but it was actually REALLY nice. Good clean area with lots of room, plenty of soap and towels.

Food: My group had a little bit of everything on the menu. Sliders were actually good, wings were good with healthy amount of sauce (Get the Maple Hot...different but good).

If I had to put an analogy to this one - I would say that most restaurants are like watching a concert on tv and this place is like being in the front row at a great show. I was immersed in Christopher's beautiful world and entertained the entire time.

As Camille H mentioned, this place may not be for everyone. There is no menu provided to pick things from. This is not a place for a quick snack, although, I bet if you asked, Christopher would provide it. If you are a picky eater or have food allergies, call ahead of time. But if you go in with the mindset that you are going to be surprised with a meal full of the freshest ingredients, wonderful combinations of flavors and fantastic stories to every dish, you will not be disappointed.

I am not sure I would bring my five year old to this place. She would enjoy it, but I think my husband and I will get most out of our dining experience with a babysitter. Since Christopher is a one man show - chef, server, host, story teller, etc. etc, each course takes awhile, and my child's attention span most likely would not last through the entire meal.

This is a fish story... No, not about the big one that got away. Nor is it about the time I was fly fishing with my dad and had to rescue him because he stepped in a deep hole and sank when his waders filled with water.... this is about the trout that saved the day.

When my wife and I arrived at the Greene House, it was earlier in the evening, still happy hour, though we were there for dinner not appetizers. Checked-in with the hostess and were quoted a  quoted 30-45 minute wait for a table. We knew the place was popular so weren't upset with the wait as we were looking forward to a wonderful dinner.

Went to the bar to order wine and that's when our disappointment started. We were sitting in plain view at the edge of the bar facing the entry and there were TWO bartenders,  In spite of this, in the 15 minutes we waited, occasionally waving and saying ""excuse me"" to get the bartenders' attention, we never even got so much as a Hi, and certainly not an opportunity to order a drink.

I had only just told my wife I wasn't willing to wait another 15-30 minutes wine free when the hostess pleasantly surprised us by saying a table was ready. Our relief was short lived however.

After being seated, it was approximately 5 minutes before our server came to the table. We ordered wine and water.

Our wine and water came NINE minutes later... a total of over 30 minutes since we entered the restaurant before we received our first beverage.

We skipped an appetizer, planning ahead for dessert, and for our entree ordered Rainbow Trout with a side of Truffle Parmesan Fries.

Approximately 15 minutes later, our SIDE of Truffle Parmesan Fries showed up... sans trout. 

When asked about the missing trout, she said it'd be a few more minutes because the kitchen was backed up. When asked why she brought the side of fries, she said she thought we wanted them first, a leap of logic that totally escaped us. 

When our server said she could take the fries back ""to keep them warm until our trout was ready"", my wife and I looked at each other in amazement and made a spontaneous decision that given we were now STARVING, our original side of fries would serve us better as a hot appetizer than as a reheated side with dinner.

Finally, a few minutes after our Truffle Parmesan Fries were gone, our trout arrived. As I indicated in the begining, it saved the day. The fish was fresh, perfectly prepared and exceptional.

As good as the trout was however, is wasn't good enough to make us ever return to the Greene House. There is no reason any customer should suffer through such slow and uninspired service when there are at least a dozen restaurants within a 2 mile radius of this one (much less dozens more throughout the Phoeniz metro area), that are SIGNIFICANTLY more enjoyable.

I like the sense of accomplishment you get from eating a cupcake. You may have had a hard day, but you finished an entire cupcake. That's validation. It makes me happy.

Sprinkles is a great place to go for a sugar fix, but I have to say there are some negatives. I have had a dry cupcake there. They are a bit on the expensive side.

The worst sin of all? Their red velvet is ""a southern style light chocolate cake with a cream cheese frosting"". I have to disagree. I don't detect any cream cheese flavor in that frosting.

The first time I devoured a Sprinkles cupcake it was magical. I was particularly impressed with the black and white- ""Belgian dark chocolate with creamy vanilla frosting"". I was in a shoebox Los Angeles apartment and the cupcakes seemed of adequate size. The next time was the new location  am currently reviewing and they were consumed in a larger-than-shoebox Chandler house. They seemed a little small. The third time was in my car- a Subaru Baja, and the cupcakes, again seemed sizable.

I think this is my very first review that has been demoted to 1 star after being on the coveted 5 star for a long time. 

So, where do I start. After feeling dog sick for a few days, I finally decided to ""walk-in"" to this place because that's what they do now supposedly. They take walk in patients who are seen by the NP. I signed in at 8:20 and was not called in the back until 10:00am. Then I waited another 35 minutes for the NP to come in and see me. By the time everything was over, it was 11:00am before I walked out of this place. 

I asked to talk to Brenda, the office manager and was brushed off twice. Supposedly she is going to call me but would not see me when i was there for two and a half hours! I guess she didn't have the balls to face me at that point. What could she have said really? 

The front desk lady did a screw up and let another walk in patient go before me even though he came 10 minutes after I had already signed in. When I pointed that out, she said he came before me and I had to show her the sign in chart. Instead of apologizing, she just kept doing what she was busy doing without acknowledging her mistake. 

When the NP did come see me, she missed a couple of key things in my chart that she totally should have asked me about. I was quite appalled. I had to point out a deathly allergy that I have even though it should already be in my chart.

"7311","zCfFoD0BsWUjaBtjwMGaYg","4","On a cold winter day, the craving for hot comfort in a bowl makes a person do strange things. It found me driving to a kind of shady part of Mesa, while braving the cold winds in search of a perfect bowl of phò.

My new holy grail of Vietnamese restaurants is Phú Thành, located in a rundown strip mall on Southern and Extension. A good Vietnamese restaurant is usually kind of old, slightly dingy and super cheap, and in this case all the basics were met and exceeded.

Phú Thành is a no-frills kind of place. Inside it screams for a makeover. Though clearly from another era, it is clean and functional. The service is friendly and the kitchen is fast.

There might be a slight familiarity here the owners of Phú Thành and my favorite central Vietnamese joint Da Vàng are brothers. The menus of the two places are almost identical, and they offer a lot.

The No. 50 Chà Giò ($2) is what good Vietnamese cooking is all about. Two golden-brown, crunchy egg rolls filled with shrimp and pork are hands on and interactive. Served with a plate of lettuce leaves and herbs, you wrap the egg roll in lettuce and garnish with mint and cilantro, then dunk them into the house-made n?òc châm, a sweet and spicy dipping sauce. The fresh lettuce and herbs cut through the richness of the egg roll, which on its own might be slightly oily.

Applying the same hands-on approach, the No. 54 Bánh Xèo ($3.95) replaces the rolls with a pan-fried rice flour crepe. The exterior is slightly crispy, while the soft interior is filled with shrimp and bean sprouts. Of all the Bánh Xèo I've tried, this version is by far my favorite. It's full of flavor and texture.

Phó (pronounced like the bad word) is not only fun to say, but fun to eat. Eight versions of the noodle soup are offered, from traditional beef to chicken. Pay attention to the menu description when ordering since you might wind up with unfamiliar cuts of meat.

I'm adventurous and love the textures of beef tendon and tripe, so I was in heaven when my steaming bowl of No. 1 Phò Phú Thành ($4.95) arrived. The broth was incredibly fragrant with clove and star anise. This really should be made into an air freshener.

Along with the condiments at the table, the soup comes with a plateful of basil and bean sprouts. But also include limes and chilis to add texture, flavor and depth to your pho experience.

For something hearty and comforting, the No. 7 Mì Bò Kho ($4.75) is a bowl of chewy egg noodles filled with a beef stew. Tender pieces of stewed carrots and beef grace the rich and complex flavors of the dark and tasty brew.

If you're carbohydrate loading, order a slab of French bread to absorb all of the bone-warming elixir at the bottom of the bowl.

The food here: amazing. The coffee: the best. The atmosphere: perfect. So why only four stars? Because the service can be absolutely abysmal at times. Given, there are a few star performers here who give it their all, bust their ass, and never forget a customer's name. And Sue, the owner, really seems to genuinely care about each and every person that walks in the door. But the service is so unwaveringly slow that I am often prevented from eating here due to time constraints. Example: I once ordered a cup of soup to go-- soup, mind you, that is completely ready and cooked, just sitting in a big tureen in the back-- and it took 35 minutes. 

So, yes, the food is amazingly fresh, inventive, delectable. The prosciutto is shipped in from Italy. The bread is natural and baked locally.

Needless to say my expectations were way off - I should have been thinking less mom-and-pop Paris bake-shop and more Payard Patisserie, with delicate pastry works of art in a stark, hip space.

The Good: Shannon, California Sea Bass, Michelle (Manager's) Customer Service
The Bad: Fried Calamari, Our last waiter's breath

The first visit to this establishment was our encounter with Shannon.  Shannon was a pure delight as our waitress.  She made our first visit absolutely fun.  My wife had a tilapia dish that she was less than enamored with but I had the California Sea Bass and that tasted very good.  In fact, it was so good that I regretted not getting a glass of Chardonnay to go with it.  The fish had a very nice texture and taste.

Our second visit was our first encounter with the fried calamari.  As our guest so eloquently said, ""If this was my first impression of fried calamari, I would not have liked it.""  The calamari was overcooked and there was so much oil running on the plate.  We called this issue to Michelle's attention and she agreed 100% that the dish was not prepared properly.  She gave us a coupon to come back there and eat at any time.  

However, our waiter's breath was another story. Whenever he spoke, I could smell his pungent (trust me, a lot better than what I really wanted to say) breath to the point I almost donned a gas mask.  There are very few things that would cause me to lose my appetite.  His malodorous breath and the calamari with more grease than a Jiffy Lube accomplished the feat.",0,2,0,2.5,"Positive","4"

Mind you the restaurant was already noisy when the GM Miranda Geranios instructed us to leave; other patrons were complaining. That was news to us- and we've seen far worse outbursts in the past from children. Ironically, our son at that moment was playing happily with the other couple when she rudely asserted herself. 

We were in the middle of dinner and to add insult to injury, she didn't even offer to compensate us for a future visit without our little guy. Just go home without dinner and pay the bill. Of course, she herself has no children.

Their coffee is locally roasted and, while not my favorite, is well above average in Phoenix. Their drive-thru is a great feature for those mornings when I'm running late. For the coffee adverse, Copper Star serves chai, tea, smoothies, Italian sodas, and some unique drinks including a black cherry limeade. Foodwise, there is a wide selection of baked goods,including some of the best bagels. They also have decent lunch offerings, such as sandwiches and a tasty hummus platter. But where they shine is their 'home baked' cupcakes. (I've seen Mayor Gordon here on several occasions getting his cupcake fix!) 

Despite being in a converted gas station/garage, the atmosphere is quite a bit more cozy than most of the other coffee shops in central Phoenix. While the sandblasted block walls and exposed ceiling let that building's industrial past peak through, this is offset by rotating art work and selection of comfortable (if a bit dingy) couches and easy chairs as well as small bistro tables and long 'work' tables to choose from.

The rooms were comfortable and the whole facility was clean. One thing that must be commented on is the staff was not only efficient but they were very friendly and nice. All of the food and room service I ordered was filled with superb flavor and had good presentation. The hotel also has a botanical garden, herb garden, multiple lawns, and it contains different food services. I highly recommend the ranchero pulled pork tacos and the sushi.

We ordered three different appetizers that were  on happy hour before our entrees. The Wontons, the queso dip, and the Chicken tenders. The tenders were good. They were beer battered and  tender. The queso dip was pretty bland and the chips awful. They weren't stale but just obviously super low quality. The Wontons were obviously frozen and sitting on a bed of syrup. It was like having desert and appetizers at the same time. When it came time to order entrees i was the last to do so. I asked my server about an option between three entrees and she danced around all of them suggesting that I have a pulled pork sandwich that was clearly less expensive than the ribs, steak or taco plate I inquired about. I should have headed her advice. It isn't every day a server tries to under sale you I ordered the ribs and was disappointed. the texture was off the flavor was bland except for the sauce which was spicy and not good enough to mask the bad flavor. My server Liz was awesome. She was attentive and friendly. She noticed I hadn't eaten my entree and took it away. The manager came back and was apologetic he offered me another entree and I took Liz's advice and got the pulled pork sandwich. It was much better. The staff was good and did there job very well.

Love this place. Took my daughter here a year ago to get her very FIRST haircut. We had Miss Tara, who provided us with a ""first haircut"" certificate and she also had these tiny quarter-size ziploc bags for my daughter's very first strand of hair that she cut. The haircut was $15. Along with the haircut, Miss Tara styled it and put clips and glitter in her hair. My daughter LOVED it.

I took my daughter for her SECOND haircut today. We had Miss Annette. She was great. Again, my daughter got her hair styled after her haircut and got glitter and flowers put into her hair. The haircut was $15. We also got a punchcard, where you're 9th haircut will be free.

Went next door to Bar Bianco, ordered a bottle of wine and patiently waited outside.  I think that the wait is part of the allure for people.  Also, after waiting hungry for 3 hours, the food becomes tastier because you are starving.  

Finally get a table at 10:15.  Order the caprese salad and another bottle of wine.  The ingredients are very fresh.  The Mozz is excellent, the tomatoes are very very fresh and tasty and the basil was great as well.  

The server didnt make any recommendations on wine or food.  A bit odd.  Given that the wait is 3 hours and that it's pricy for a pizza joint, you'd think that the service would be excellent.  Not at all the case.  This guy acts like everyone here is a regular.  The reality is that with 3 hour waits for a table, i don't have time to be a regular at this place. 

We ordered 2 pizzas to try.... Biancoverde and Wiseguy.  They were pretty good, again with good ingredients.  I wouldn't say it was the best pizza i've ever had, but very tasty.  Asked for some Balsamic to go with the Mozz and Tomatoes... had to ask the server 2 times, finally we snagged a food runner, she got it for us.  I shouldnt have to ask for something 3 times. I mean really, this place only has like 6 tables... pay attention to the guests.  

I guess the moral here is that trying this place is all about the experience and saying that you've been there.  While Bianco is good you can go to Parlor or Cibo and get very good (comparable) pizza without a 3 hour wait.

""Big deal,"" I thought. ""How can a Hawaiian festival be fun?""

Well, the food was amazing. And after having half a rotisserie chicken, I was craving for more.

A few days later, I finally began my search for the perfect (or near perfect) Hawaiian restaurant, in which I can satisfy my Hawaiian cravings.

My first stop was Mai Island Grill, located in/near the Arizona State University campus. Parking was a bit of a challenge; this is especially true during the lunch hour.

When I finally found a parking spot, I went in and ordered. I had the short ribs plate. The plates include one scoop of macaroni salad and steamed rice.

After placing my order for the short ribs, I ordered the Spam musubi.

The guy preparing food replied with a laugh.

""Is it good?"" I asked

Jay -- the man who operates this restaurant -- replied, ""Yes it's good."" 

Then he said something about how the guy who laughs never laughs (or something like that).

About 10 minutes later, my food was ready.

The food was fantastic; just what I was looking for!

The prices are very reasonable. Plates are about $10 and less.

I also suggest that you try the fish, beef, grilled chicken, and pork katsu.

And finally, I hope that this place continues to provide the same liberal portions. Also, I think it would be cool if Mai Island Grill began serving two scoops of macaroni salad and two scoops of rice (just a fantasy of mine).

We went on a Wednesday night around 7:30pm and it was empty while Pita Jungle was packed. Just the two of us on the patio, which was very nice. The interior and atmosphere are great. Nice tables & chairs, candles, shelves with wine bottles and art, and a very nice bar.

An Iranian family owns the restaurant and cooks everything themselves. That's the first sign of a high-quality establishment. They were incredibly nice to us and brought us whatever we needed. They gave us some good suggestions, like their Iced Black Tea, which is fantastic. It has a few other elements to it including Lavender. They brought us extra pita when we ordered some appetizers as well without us even asking.

For our appetizers, we tried the hummus and the tabooli. The hummus was very creamy but a little plain. We wished there was more flavor or spice to it. Not a big deal. That was the only part of our meal that was not 5 stars, but 4 stars. The tabooli....ridiculous. I've never been a fan of tabooli. It usually has too much parsley. But their version was balanced perfectly.

For an entree, I tried the Chicken Shawarma and we split a side of Basmati rice with saffron. A huge plate of rice with great seasoning. The saffron and olive oil gave the fluffy rice great texture. The Shawarma was fresh and delicious. The chicken was cooked and seasoned nicely.

For dessert, we tried the Persian vanilla ice cream with rose water and saffron as well as the Baghlava. The ice cream was some of the best we've had. Great flavor. The Baghlava was a great complement to the ice cream. A nice sweetness from the honey and the flaky dough was great.

So in summary, great atmosphere, great owners, out-of-this-world food, and very affordable. Everything we had came to about $32. We will return many times in the future because their menu is very promising. Just wish their name fit the type of place that it is.

This place has a lounge area with a good sized bar and couch area. Over where the 10 lanes are, there are about 4 pool tables, another bar, and another table and couches area. The end of the lanes have screens above them to watch sports or music videos. They play good music very loud. I had a really great time. 
My only complaint, we reserved lanes for 4 hours, and when the 4 hours was up, they wanted us out immediately. They started bussing the tables just taking drinks away. I was busy changing my shoes and didn't notice the busboy grabbed my drink. Excuse me, I just purchased that. I let him know that I understood they wanted us gone, but should ask the person sitting there which drink is theirs before throwing it away. As we were leaving, I was at the other table in our area and the busboy asks me if any of the drinks on that table were mine. I reminded him that he threw mine away and he should probably be asking that question to somebody else. It really annoyed me.

"7680","i8PeT0FaEQseyCQHkKsJng","4","The name says it all.  This family owned restaurant (3 to be exact) specializes in tortas but they also carry your staple Mexican fast-food affair you would find in AZ.  Everything I or anyone else has had has been solid.  Just in case you don't know what a torta is, the best way I can explain what one is that it is essentially a toasted sandwich with a fusion of Mexican and American ingredients.  When it comes to TEG's tortas, there are a few standouts.  One would be the cochinita.

Cochinita which is marinated pork is absolutely delicious by itself, but in a torta, it is absolutely scrumptious!!!  My best description of what cochinita is to think of pulled pork that is braised in a slightly sweet, salty, and spicy redish/orangeish sauce.  In addition, it has American sandwich staples such as mayo, shredded lettuce.  What makes it a ""torta"" are the slices of sweet and sour pickled jalapenos and carrots and slices of avocado (and they do not skimp).  What completes the sandwich, I mean torta, is the bread.  It's always warm and fluffy in the inside and the outside always has a nice crisp texture from the grill.
 
The other torta I would strongly recommend is the carne asada.  The combination of the carne asada steak with mayo, fresh pico de gallo, and lettuce along with the warm bread makes this torta an absolute winner (my mouth is actually watering just thinking about it!).

The Cubana, which has your typical ingredients that come with any spin on the classic Cuban, is also good.  If you are a big fan of Cubans, then this one may be for you. But in my humble opinion, this does not anywhere near come close to the yummy goodness of the cochinita and carne asada.

The Hawiiana (Hawaiian) is also a relative good choice.  With the combination of Ham and fresh grilled pineapple along with other condiments, it also is descent selection.

As I stated before, they do have staple Arizona style Mexican fast-food here and there are a few I would recommend.  One would be the flautas (large deep fried rolled tacos).

The pollo is the one I would suggest.  If you envision your typical fried rolled tacos with guacamole and cheese, well this is not that, this is even better!  The flautas at TEG are larger with much more stuffing then your typical rolled tacos.  In addition, they make them with yummy flour tortillas, not your typical corn.  The shredded chicken is well seasoned and moist.  The tortilla is always fried perfectly, light crisp on the outside with the inside of the tortilla still soft.

The burritos here are good, actually better than average, but because the tortas here are the showcase, everything else takes a backseat.  The rice and beans are hit and miss, especially at the Chandler location.

I used to give TEG four and a half stars, but with the mistake of expanding too quickly, combined with quality and consistency falling a bit, I would have to give them three and half stars; four stars would be stretching. I'm anal so three and three quarter seems to fit.

For example, the Phoenix location, which the Son runs and where he started the chain has a few issues.  For example, the Cochinita at the Phoenix location is always drier and saltier than the other two locations.  In addition, they have certain items only at that location that the other two do not.  One would be their Sonoran style hotdogs, which are excellent and an item I would highly recommend.  When I have gone to both the Mesa and Chandler location and asked for them, and unfortunately they said they don't carry them.  I was disappointed to say the least. 

Another example of inconsistency is the last time I went to the Chandler location.  I brought a couple of out of town guests, and I was a little disappointed because the bread was a little too bready (dense) and not light and fluffy as usual.  When all the ingredients are in perfect symphony, you have one amazing torta, but when one ingredient is off such as something like the bread being too dense throws off that harmonious balance of flavors and textures.  In this case, it made a difference from a four and half star sandwich to a 3 star sandwich (which is still good in my book, but not great).

The best and most consistent is their Mesa location.  I think that it is because Mom and Pops run that particular location (well they used to anyways).  Everything has always been consistently delici-oh-so-good.

Overall, would I still recommend Tortas El Guero, and do I still go?  Yes, but I wouldn't rave about the place like I once did especially with the inconsistencies I've experienced as of late.",0,1,0,13,"Positive","4"

* bread to start - excellent...love the lightly buttered and salted top
* tomato and mozzarella salad - excellent - one of the best i've ever had.  great dressing and ample balls of fresh mozzarella.
* pretzel fondue - the pretzels were excellent but the fondue and mustard were no bueno.  the fondu was gritty and the mustard lacked the kick that I love on pretzels.
* burger - pretty solid but nothing special
* mac n' cheese with Shriner's sausage - very unique and very tasty.  it was worth having once but I wouldn't get it again.
* tater tots - perfectly cooked.  salty/crunchy on the outside, fluffy on the inside.  The only thing that would have made these better is some type of aioli or other special dipping sauce other than ketchup.

The service was top notch from the get go starting with the valet. We were seated by a pleasant hostess in the large main room. Our waiter was an entertaining gentleman, that's one huge plus I have to say about Mastro's is they ""usually"" have seasoned wait staff they really know their product.

They brought us the great basket of warm breads, we ordered bottled water for all and a bottle of some 06 Sauv Blanc that was mighty tasty. It was impossible to have an empty glass this night!

Everyone had fillet's but me of course, I mainly had apps, side's, wine and desert ;) I did try the seared ahi tuna it was ok I wasn't too impressed with it though. Beefsteak tomato & mozz (see pics) very yummy! The creamed corn, sauteed asparagus and mash were all very good!! I couldn't talk anyone into the lobster mash or any caviar boohoo me. =(  Everyone loved their meal!!

My g/f was coming back from the bathroom and missed a step or something somehow she lost her shoe but there was a busser or someone right behind her he picked it up for her and even put it back on for her! Now that is what I call 5 Star Service!!

I have been there a few times because it's close to my work and I received some gift certificates for my birthday. Unfortunately after the last experience, I can't go back.  Although they are very nice and have great prices, I have to reveal the ugly truth: 
1. They don't put any effort into sanitizing the tools or the pedicure bowl. I actually saw them clean the brushes and tools in the water I was soaking my feet in and then just rinse out the bowl after they were done... not spray, soap, nothing!
2. Reason #1 probably explains why my heals cracked so severely after my pedicure that they began to bleed.  I had to use peroxide, neosprin, and bandages for almost a week to get it heal. 
3. They water down their nail polish... so much that it destroys the bond and polish never actually dries.

"7744","t-CBoiOR2ENjAZ_ED_xRCw","3","Old Town Scottsdale has a personality disorder. It tries to be one thing during the day and another at night. Merchants are gouged for hellish fees in order to provide the ""free"" parking so prices reflect this big gouge as some have to make up six figures per year (no joke). During the day Old Town caters to the typical tourists with skin that hasn't seen the sun since Eisenhower was president. The little shops sell a combination of crap and genuine goods. Restaurants cater to the over 60 crowd for lunch and the idea is to keep people milling around until they have spent all of their money. The perimeter of Old Town is alive with baseball, a hospital, banks and other real world establishments. At night the ""clubs"" open and each one thinks it's the Viper Room or the Abbey. Sorry, this isn't LA. High cover charges for lame, watered drinks and dead ambiance won't cut it. They make up for being dull with loud music. The rooftop bar concept seems to be dying off after locals who can't sleep through the racket take a few shots at the places from time to time. I can't blame them. A mile away the noise from these places is still thumping loud. It must be horrific to be at one of those rooftop bars. 

But to be fair, Arizona is not known for night life. It's a place where the sidewalks are rolled up at dusk and they try to cash in on big events like the occasional Super Bowl. They also try to create a night scene Studio 54 style with a new ""hot""place popping up and when it is no longer trendy, they change the name and it becomes something else. Restaurants in Old Town also change names in the summer in hope of fleecing the same crowd the next tourist season. Many are now corporate-owned and the local restaurants have had no choice but to follow the downward spiral. 

On the up-side, look for the local bars and by that I don't mean clubs. The bars such as the Blue Moose are locally owned and serve up good food at decent prices, good drinks and offer friendly service. Stay away from the $30 per entree places and just go cheap and have a good time.

Apparently, one of their regulars LITERALLY drank herself to death - spent a week in the hospital before whe finally died.  Instead of a funeral, her husband and family set up a memorial at her favorite bar...  The place was filled with long hugs and sobbing... all while the gal's husband was hammered and wobbled leaning on the end of the bar.  Sad, sad, sad, sad...... on SO many levels.........

That said, we just tried to stay away from it all... and our server (Bobbi - hope I spelled it right) was really great in keeping happy, warm, and chatty.

Ignoring the other patrons that night, then, this place is definitely a great little legit Irish pub (apparently the oldest in the Valley for you history nerds)!

Firstly, they have all sorts of Irish food items (cottage pie, corned beef and cabbage, bangers and mash, beef stew, seafood, and they even have a boxty).  We tried a couple different things that were all tasty!

Next, almost all of their beer taps are dedicates to Irish or UK beers (Guinness, Smithwick's, Harp, Kilkenny, Magner's, Newcastle, etc...)... and they know how to pour a stout!

They didn't have live music that night (apparently, they normally have live Irish bands 6 nights a week)... but they played a great array of REAL Irish music the whole time!

I read a couple reviews that claimed it's not an authentic Irish pub...... but I'm guessing these folks haven't spent a whole lot of time in Ireland?  Understand that ANY bar, in America, has to have cheeseburgers and chicken fingers - because you're not IN Ireland...  That said...... if a bar plays Irish music... has 7 of 10 taps dedicated to Irish and UK beers (with the other 3 Irish or UK STYLE like Killians, Kiltlifter, and Sam Adams)... has all SORTS of Irish food on the menu... real Irish signage (not shamrocks)... proper stout pours in two-parts... plays Irish sports on TV... supports the local Irish clubs..... what makes it NOT a legit Irish Pub?

"7765","pK336aYSodY-wsAtGjbecA","1","My sister recently took her '98 VW New Beetle to First Class Auto in Scottsdale, AZ for an overheating issue.  I'm normally the one who does the maintenance on the vehicle but I was ~600 miles away.  She described the symptoms as follows: overheating light came on while she was stuck in construction traffic and went back off once she was moving again.  I immediately suggested that the radiator fans may not be coming on for some reason.  Since I wasn't around to look at it, she took it to First Class Auto.

She relayed the symptoms to the guys at First Class and also SPECIFICALLY requested they check  radiator fan functionality.

They told her the water pump was cracked and leaking, needed a new thermostat and also replace the timing belt and serpentine belt while they were in there (water pump is driven by the timing belt on this engine--2.0L 8V 4 cyl AEG code).  Well, a) I personally replaced the timing belt, water pump and serpentine belt about 10,000 miles ago as preventative maintenance.  What's more is the car hasn't lost any coolant since the job.  So the water pump being cracked is highly unlikely!  I did not replace the thermostat, though.  Once she called me to tell me this, I told her to decline the work and either take it somewhere else or wait for me to make a trip out.

I had a job to do that brought me almost half way to the Phoenix area so I decided I would make the trip the rest of the way to have a look for myself yesterday.  FIRST thing I did was check the radiator fans.  I turned on the AC and the fans didn't come on at all.  I pop the cover off the strip fuse panel that resides on top of the battery and found a melted 30 AMP fuse.  Guess what that fuse is for?  The RADIATOR FANS!  Imagine that.  Being a car that lived most of its life in Michigan, some of the fuses and the fuse panel itself had become corroded and caused the one fuse and part of the fuse panel to melt.  The coolant level was exactly at the max level, right where it was after I did the maintenance on it 10,000 miles ago, not to mention I checked it before her recent trip to Scottsdale (didn't have to add anything.  The car doesn't leak a drop of coolant).

Local dealer had a new fuse panel in stock, I swapped it out and replaced all 3 of the 30 amp blade fuses as they were all corroded pretty badly.  The larger strip fuses were still decent.  The radiator fans now work as normal and the car does not overheat.  The hose coming off the thermostat also becomes pressurized and hot at the correct temperature as well, so that's definitely not a problem!  Fans also come on automatically once the coolant temp hits 99 deg Celsius like they're supposed to.  Problem solved!

I drove down to First Class Auto today to give them a chance to explain/defend themselves, but there was only one guy working in the shop who she didn't recognize and no one at the counter.  What great customer service!

We were there on a Saturday, right in the middle of happy hour, and enjoyed a ridiculous evening of items that were mostly $8.  Wine flights, flatbreads, certain bottles of wine = $8.  BOTTLES OF WINE.  I'm sure they were just cleaning out old inventory, since they have hundreds of listings, but for these two wines, until they ran out of bottles, the bottles were $8.  

We had the Northern Territory flatbread (pancetta, yukon gold potatoes, rosemary, crème fraîche and smoked gouda). Yum.

That puts me in a weird head space, review wise. While this hotel is only three years old, it sounds like it may as well have been built in the 70's. I hear all the conversations of the folks in the hallway, I hear people walking down the hallway above mine, and for the past two days, the heavy footsteps of the person above me woke me up well before my alarm. 

Normally I'm pretty lenient about things like that but, c'mon. This is a roadside haven meant for business travelers (and tourists too stupid to see that this hotel is near NOTHING you're trying to visit Arizona for) to get some damned shut eye. It's a little tough under the current conditions.

Aside from, you know, sleeping. The rest of this Courtyard is pretty nice. The interior and amenities vastly make up for the absolute desolation outside. It's located off 91st, just north of the 10 freeway. There's a little patch of desert and an ITT Technical Institute across the parking lot that seems too small to handle the amount of folks who need to park.

Anyway, back to the inside. This is a newer Courtyard. Marriott is drastically trying to get its old chains into a modernization fit to compete with Hilton and Hyatt's business lines. This renovation, (or new construction in this case) includes adding a ""restaurant"" for breakfast and dinner. And a bar across the way open from 5pm-10pm. Thank God for these two additions because the pickin's around the hotel are slim as a Calvin Klein model. I think there's a Chipotle around the corner. I didn't see you jump for joy. What, not impressed?

The rooms are the modern Courtyard style with LG flat screens, fancy shampoos, interesting art on the walls, wired and wireless internet...etc. This location has low tile showers with glass doors. Fancy. I'm used to the sliding curtain that ends up soaking the floor because it's all cloth anyway.

If they could get the sound issues fixed (lucky me, I'm on the side of the hotel NOT facing the freeway) I'd easily give another star. Proximity to anything worthwhile is pretty bad, but the point of this hotel appears to be for housing workers in the local warehouses nearby. There's plenty of regulars here week after week after week as the bartender told me a few nights ago.

One definite draw is that their weight room is pretty top notch and, of course, dead. You can easily be the only one in there night after night while folks who really need to use a gym will walk by you with minds set on beers, staring into the window as if to ask why anyone would try to work off the food they eat. Hmmm... I wonder.

The fact of the matter is though, that this place has a very unique touch. This restaurant is a staple not only for groceries, but also its food. The owner is persian, so you can tell where the tastes are coming from. Its somewhat hidden in the heart of Phoenix, but that's ok, once you are there you will be glad you found it.

This place is unique because they make their own bread! Are you kidding me? I only recently found out about this place like 3 years ago, and I've been living in Phoenix for 20 years. The chicken and beef shawarma have a special, authentic taste because of the fresh bread. One of the best parts about the shawarma is not only its amazing taste, but the pricing is very fair as well. I don't think I can stress this enough, but the fresh bread just sets this place apart from all the impostors in the Phoenix metro area. Why haven't the other restaurants caught on? I know of maybe one persian restaurant that makes their own bread, but their pricing makes them a different story (I'm talking about 'The Persian Room' in Scottsdale).

I just don't understand how other restaurants can serve the bread that comes in plastic bags from a manufacturer hundreds of miles away. 'Good bread' and 'Arabic bread' are all good forms of pita that have great shelf life due to the ridiculous amounts of preservatives, but they just don't taste fresh.

If you like the bread, head to the back of the store and there is a shelf of freshly baked pita bread, its baked throughout the day, I think. I can tell because sometimes my bread is still warm and the bag has a little condensation. Beware though, the bread gets hard and crunchy after a few days, so you really need to use it quickly. This isn't bad, its just I think they choose not to add preservatives to ensure the freshness of the pita.

I usually just get the chicken or beef shawarma, but I decided I'd get a kabob plate one day because I also wanted hummus. The beef kabob plate came with hummus, bread, 2 skewers of beef kabob, and some pickles and onions. Wow. The beef kabobs were cooked perfectly, and were EXTREMELY tender. It was a tad bit on the lemony side, but I suppose that was necessary to make it so tender. Perhaps some of the best 'persian kabobs' I have ever had. The hummus was definitely good as well, I can't stand restaurants that crack open a can of premade hummus. This restaurant certainly did not disappoint with the hummus.

I know friends in Tucson that make stops specifically at this place for shawarma, and rightly so. If you're weary of persian food, just check this place out. Its not expensive at all, food for two is like $15. The wide variety of ethnic foods is also interesting.",0,0,0,8.5,"Positive","4"

He was the bartender as well, and still payed tons of attention to my table. He was very nice, and very helpful. He had extensive knowledge of the menu. He was also very personable. He laid out samples of their various barbeque sauces while giving some details about each one. He squirted them out onto an extra plate he brought to the table, and he made the shape of a smiley face with all the sauces. He made that dining experience so good that I wish I could write a review about him personally and suggest to his managers that he get a raise! I couldn't hear him when he stated his name over a large group that had just come in and was moving tables, but he was wonderful.
  Also, one of the people with me is from the east coast, and likes vinegar-based barbeque sauce. They didn't have any of that kind in their current rotation of sauces, and he actually went back to the kitchen and explained the situation. A lady from the kitchen made a vinegar-based barbeque sauce from scratch just because one of us had mentioned how much we loved it.
   I've never experienced service like that, and really can't say enough about how great this guy, and all other staff I came into contact with, was! Great job to whoever hired him.

"7825","81aYJVPnSXbtsRHLSqnlng","4","""Buy Local Coffee"" is what a sign out front of this establishment says.  So that's what I did.  I went to Copper Star Coffee to get my drink of choice, an iced coffee with cream.  I enjoyed the flavor.  It was better than Starbucks and quite a few cents cheaper.  SCORE!!!  I became a regular.  I stuck with my ice coffee for months but their bakecase was calling my name every time I would enter.  I found out Copper Star bakes their own pastries fresh daily.  Another SCORE!!!  No preservatives or high fructose corn syrup.  I started adding a scone with my iced coffee.  They have chocolate chip, lemon, blueberry, etc.  Delicious!!!  The apple sauce spice cake is now my favorite.  It is a vegan pastry.  It is flavorful and the glaze is so slight but fantastic.  Not a vegan by the way.  

I have been slowly branching out among the Copper Star menu.  Try the Black Cherry Limeade.  The specialty coffee drinks are quite good too.  The blended toffee drink rocks.  The antioxidant smoothie is refreshing.  The other smoothies are okay.  They use syrup in those.  I don't know how healthy that makes them.  (Real fruit please).

Let's talk about their sandwiches now shall we.  I have tried their sesame tuna, the curry chicken, the deviled egg salad, and the veggie.  All of them are winners.  You wont be disappointed.  Copper Star just unveiled there new sub sandwiches as well.  They use a local butcher's sausages for their subs.  Awesome.  Way to keep it in the community.

I was excited, because Cycle purports to be a pro-bicycle bar/restaurant.  We rolled up, all excited.  There were ample bike racks for our nearly 100 riders.  However, when we entered the hotel, we were brusquely directed to the bar entrance.  Having been to the restaurant before, I wandered out to check the dining room.  I was immediately turned back at the entrance and told the dining room was ""reservations only.""

I'm happy to report that the experience was most excellent at Great Wall and that it lived up to the hype.  Upon getting there, we were given a number to wait as the restaurant was completely full, there were probably 150+ people there dining, however, we were seated within 15 minutes.  As soon as we  sat down, the carts started rolling by with various plates of items to try.

The pancake, shu mai, shrimp, duck, and sliced beef inside a wrapper are highly recommended, all were excellent.  I did have a bit of trouble taking the shrimp out of the steam container because their rice wrappers were sticking a bit, but that does happen.

I would advise that if you have an allergy to shrimp that you make sure to ask the server what is in some of the items because they do come with shrimp, including their egg rolls.  Since my dad has a shrimp allergy we did have to watch for that.  I did want to try their egg rolls but I would have been the only one eating them, and they were big enough to make a meal in itself.

The sliced duck was one of the best I have had at a restaurant, well cooked with crispy tasty skin, and not too many bones to get in the way, and very reasonably priced at $6.25 for a plate.  Most other Dim Sum plates are $2.25 or $3.15 so you can end up eating a lot for a very reasonable price.

I entered Mimi's Cafe at the end of possibly worst day ever. I came in looking to order food for takeout and get home to drown my sorrows in comfort food. i was directed by the hostess up front to go stand by the bakery and i would be able to order take out. i waited not 15 seconds and was greeted with a huge smile from a lovely girl named Danielle. She gave me a menu and told me to ask if i had questions and inquired if i had been there before. i looked at the menu for some time, unable to clear my mind enough to decide. She told me i was welcome to take a seat, and when i apologized for taking so long she responded with a smiley ""where's the fire? take your time, can i get you a glass of wine while you decide?"" wine was a perfect idea! I finally ordered and sat drinking my wine. i waited, and then waited a little longer, Danielle the young girl doing take out informed me the kitchen was working as fast as they could but are very busy, she apologized for the wait and offered complimentary bread  and convinced me to buy a a second glass of wine. When she brought me the second glass i had just gotten off the phone and was visibly shaken with more bad news. Somehow this young girl had the courage to ask if everything was alright and what she could do to help. It was just the olive branch i needed. Just the inquiry was enough to make me feel better. i told her i was fine and thanked her for her compassion. finally my food was ready. She boxed everything with care for the drive home. All this time smiling. i couldn't help but notice Danielle interact with the other employees they always laughed or high fived her with each exchange. She had brightened my day, and it was clear she is a light for others in Mimi's Cafe. This is the kicker...my bill was $30 and some change...i gave her what i thought was two $20 dollar bills, but in reality was a $50 and a $20. The young girl ran outside and stopped me saying sir, I'm not sure these bills are right. i was overwhelmed by her honesty and told her no, i thought they were two 20's but the difference would be her reward for honesty.

The only pleasant thing about the evening was the reservation and seating were right on time for our large group (15 people). And of course because we were celebrating a super special person.

I'll keep this update short and sweet:

$3 for a CAN OF SODA? Get real. I knew it'd be overpriced but I was at least expecting a mini bottle or something. But a can? COME ON. You bought that in bulk and paid .03342 cents for it. FAIL.

Your servers: IDIOTS. First it takes our server 15 minutes to come around the first time and take drink orders. Then she's back another 15 minutes after that taking the orders again. Did you forget? Were you not paying attention the first time we around? Why did it take 30 minutes just to order drinks? And on top of that we wait another 15 to receive them. FORTY-FIVE MINUTES TO RECEIVE DRINKS IS BAD. Very, very bad. 

Also, not taking food orders until after we've been seated for ONE HOUR is BAD. VERY, VERY BAD. Seated at 8 o'clock, we didn't receive our food until almost TEN O'CLOCK. TWO HOURS FOR FOOD IS VERY, VERY BAD. Do you hear that, St. Francis? BAD.

Because I loathed the place even before this lovely birthday dinner, and because the thought of supporting such an establishment makes my blood boil, I ordered only dessert and the hubs ordered an appetizer (and add on a $3 can soda). Funny, that our bill was still nearly $30 for the both of us. Excluding tip. BAD.

Also, server: If you say you're not going to split a check, stick to your word or don't even try. Now, I'M glad you didn't stick to your stingy ""I don't split checks"", because I could foresee the mess of trying to split a $700 bill with 13 people I didn't know so well. Lucky for us, when we told you we were leaving early and asked for our check, you split it for us. A couple others caught on and did the same, but the remaining 7-8 people were not so lucky.

 I try to be lenient when I go somplace because it's unreasonable to expect to find the food here that I would at the Magazine St. Po Boy shop. 
I was also raised on popeyes, every once in awhile I would hop off the Streetcar on the way to school and get a Chicken Biscuit w/cheese. 
And frequrntly I would get a 4 piece spicy, and even though it was a chain, it was a local chain with massive quality control. 
(and yes, odds are those years are most likely why over the past 3 years I've lost 250 pounds!.... Moderation kids!)

Over the years, the chain was sold off, the original owner died, and Popeye's became more hit and miss, especially the further you got away from the south.

Heck, you get your hopes up just to see a Popeye's!
usually the stand alone's are better, and the ones attached to Gas stations are hideous.

  
I've tried a few in the Phoenix area, And have been generally unimpressed. Not horrible, but just... a very thin flavorless crust.

So it was with trepedation that I went into this location, a drive through, attatched to a gas station.
I went for a box of chichen w/biscuits. and I can say it was the best I've had in the city so far.
The man at the window was friendly, the chicken was fresh, good, solid breading. With enough heat to give a nice depth of flavor, cutting a bit deeper than other chains would dare... which is what Popyes is all about. (I'm used to some blazing hot chicken... not stupid mind you, just HOT.. this is not that, but a good flavor. With good moist flesh, and thick crunchy skin. And the meal made the travel home well.
One downside? I'm just not a fan of these biscuits, they werent old... but they were dry... and lack the lush, buttery flavor and texture that I love. These were more dense and hockypuckish than I prefer.

I so want to be able to give it a higher rating but every time I go the service is really not that great. Last week I went for wing and Wii night, 30 cent wings cant be beat. I have had better wings, but hey this is a Mexican joint and our bill was not even $4! But our waitress looked like she could care less about being there, never asked if we wanted a refill on our chips and salsa and never stopped by the table to see if we like our food. Now being in the service industry and having spent many years as a server I get that you think since the bill is so low your tip is going to suck. That simply doesn't have to be the case, we left our server a $6 tip and we weren't even there long. You get 4 tables like that an hour you are set, so perk up and smile, you never know how far that can go. 
I went there last night for Taco Tuesdays, $1 to $2 tacos can't be beat and the tacos are so tasty I always order 3, the mahi, crunchy fish and steak. The mahi was flaky and sweet, the crunchy taco had a sweet taste to it with the sauce and red onion. Not greasy at all. The steak was tender and flavorful. Again though our service was sub par. We had already finished our chips and salsa before we even got our water, took way to long, same with the food and it wasn't even that busy. We were sitting inside and there were only 20 people in the bar area and there was only one other table eating. Now our server wrote our order on her had, she seemed tired and frazzled, and we had to bring our bill to her at the end to check out, we waited a while before doing that. It seemed like she might have been the only server in the place, but she did have the help of a gentleman by the name of Frenchy. I liked Frenchy, big dude but with dry wit and he seemed like the jack of all trades for the place. Doorman, food runner, busser, you name it he was doing it. 
I will continue to come to Loco because the tacos are so damn good but I just hope they figure out the staff issues. I gave it 4 times and every time my complaint is the same, the service needs to step it up.",1,2,1,3,"Positive","4"

By the time I ventured downtown to glance at this place Phoenix was experiencing a cool down so the patio was very comfortable without the fans and misters. 

Our waitress was great and even chatted about our night and my favorite bar, SideBar. We got the L.B. favorite lavosh and I okayed the bacon even though it didn't sound too appetizing. It wasn't. I ordered some chicken sandwich that was on a french roll. The salad on the side was better than the sandwich. My friend ordered the classic turkey which was large but average. BUT I think ordering the classic sandwich was a boring mistake of its own. The fries that came with the turkey were greasy and when I ordered a amber ale and some guy brought a pale ale. I like pale ale so it wasn't too bad but it made me yearn for the amber. Yes, or course I ordered the amber next.

"7973","QimuPOgwgY52ciZBazV1Gg","3","I noticed the sign for Shakey Jake's before it even opened. I waited paitiently for it to wait... I love barbeque! :) When it finally opened, my mom and I tried to get some grub there when we walked up, the cutest little boy came out of the resturant and told us they were close and would be open again tomorrow. We left disappointed but still wanted to give Jake's a try.

Over a month later, we finally did get a chance to do just that.

We entered Shakey Jakes and saw a nice, new & clean place. There was a large counter, and several red t-shirt wearing workers dishing up what looked & smelled like yummy barbeque. We waited in line and were handed menus. The walkways were narrow and left a small amount of space to sit. We were feeling the scrunch! We then sat down with our menus and chose our meals.

I went back to the register & was disappointed in the fact that they didn't have any more MacNCheese and there was some miscommunication when it came to my mom's order. I thought it came with Fries... and it didn't, it comes with a side dish. My mom wanted Cole Slaw AND fries... instead I accidentily ordred JUST cole slaw... but they charged me an extra fee for the cole slaw... so really, I just got screwed out of a side dish and it was pretty much downhill from there.

I didn't see the lil baskets of utensils and lids and straws on top of the very tall deli case. I had to take our recipt and the cups and I pourd our drinks and sat down. The TVs were SO damned loud we were shouting at eachother. I wanted to scream ""can you PLEASE turn that down?!"" My mom had to use the rest room and I told her she needed a key, which I learned from a previous review.

Anyway, finally our food came and our order number was called and I got up thinking I had to bring it to the table, when their server told me to sit down and that she'd bring it to us... ummm... okay? but as she did, she told us that the utensils were by the register. WTF?! ARGHHH!! I was JUST there!! It was ackward, uncomfortable, annoying and frustrating.

So i got up AGAIN, if I could have just picked up my own order, I could have also gotten my utensils in one big graceful swoop. I THINK the owners need to give out those lil numbers for their tables, think Carl's Jr. So there's no more confusion. AND give out those lil bags with utensils, napkin, salt & pepper packets. Because I'm 5'6"" and I had to get on my TIPPY Toes to see what the hell was in those baskets! Also, I ordered two medium sodas, and none of their lids fit. They were TOO small or TOO large!

The cashier was really nice, but the smaller things made this place intolerable. I couldn't walk to our table without hitting EACH and every single table and chair... ugh, that's the last thing I need. a reminder that maybe having yet another meal out is the LAST thing I should be subjecting my body to.

I sat down and looked at my plate, the fuck?! I ordered pork ribs, and they gave me beef. I looked at the recipt and it said... beef. *harsh sigh* lucky for them, they both cost the same! I remembered reading their sign underneith the cashier that said they'd be happy to help you out if there's anything wrong with your order IF the food was untouched and IF you still had your recipt. sooooo... because the cashier hit beef instead of pork and I paid - I was screwed.

Choosing to just go with it, I opened up my side dishes and the yams were good. nothing great, but still good. The cole slaw was way too sweet for me. The corn bread was good!! The highlight of the meal! their cornbread is better than LoLo's! There I said it! I just wish Shakey Jake's would make theirs bigger. The ribs were VERY good, they had a serious smoke ring and the sauce had a nice bite to it. My mom didn't care for her sandwich, she said there wasn't enough sauce and that the meat was very fatty. She liked the yams and the coleslaw. We both agreed that the peach cobbler was YUMMY! I just wish they baked it longer.

When we left, I was full and not as aggravated like I was before. I do want to give Shakey Jake's another chance (maybe without my mom). To my yelpers, if you go - be sure the check your recipt, get your utensils right after you order & expect a server to bring your food when it's done.",5,5,5,1.5,"Positive","4"

After looking for a place to have a glass of wine late, I ended up here, as 3 or 4 other places in Old Town were either closed (Napoleon's and Tapas Papas Fritas both closed at 11 PM??? Well, Napoleon's closed forever, so I heard, but won't believe...) or dead. Citizen had a multi-course private affair they were finishing up.

I've been coming in here, on average maybe once or twice a year since around 2007, and let me say at AZ88 the good things don't change.

The location is excellent, as it is near my office, and the interior décor is clean, modest, and charming. The music seems to vary, but on today's trip, it appeared to be a mix of oldies and jazzy easy listening. While I've never had to wait for a table to clear, seating can be limited during lunch hours. The service is friendly and quick and the menu offerings plentiful and interesting. Vegetarians will find a handful of options here, though it is likely you can request to omit meat from any sandwich or salad. 

Carrying Boar's Head ingredients is a plus, however the way their sandwiches are assembled and the ratio of ingredients used simply doesn't work for me. Oftentimes, I find my sandwich has a bulge of deli meat in the center and much less (and sometimes none at all) toward the outer parts nearing the crust. It has been my experience that the wraps are not treated this way, though the only wrap I've tried (Mexi) lacked flavor and tasted processed. 

I've eaten one salad at Dilly's - the Greek - and, while it is tasty, I discovered a dead fly in it halfway through and haven't ordered a salad there since. 

As other reviewers have reported, the soups aren't as piping hot as I'd like, though the variety and additional ""daily soup"" is appreciated. 

The bread is deliciously soft, warm, flavorful, and large - ideal for accompanying a soup or salad. If you're accustomed to filling up on a sandwich made with normal-sized slices, I suggest ordering a half sandwich so you can sample a side of soup, salad, or dessert as well. All sandwiches are served with a pickle spear.

The cookies and brownies get 4 stars on their own.

Today I gave Dilly's another shot and ordered a new menu item, the Red Bird, on wheat. Personally, I'm not a fan. The Blazin' Buffalo, Dilly Bird, and Smokey Mountain boast far better flavor combinations, IMO. Also, my pickle spear had a hair on it.

Dilly's is a bit pricier than its nearby competition (All whole sandwiches are $6.99), though a reasonable price if shared.

"8038","VXZz5o0Fv_hByWp2o6fOSw","4","True Food Kitchen claims to not be a health-food restaurant, rather a place for great food that just so happens to be healthy. Whatever you want to call it, when you sit down, you'll be handed a card explaining nutrition guru Dr. Andrew Weil's food philosophies and explaining their ingredients and food items until you no longer have an appetite. However, give this place a chance - it's not all about health at the sacrifice of flavor. The decor perfectly highlights the culinary concept, with clean, modern lines, big open windows, and LOTS of green. Andrew's Elixir, one of their refresher drinks, was delightful. The best food item we had was the caramelized onion tart appetizer, with gorgonzola cheese, black figs, and caramelized onions on a crispy flat crust. It was the perfect balance of the sweet mild onions and sweet figs with savory cheese and light, crispy crust. Our server said this is the same crust as their pizzas, so next time I'd like to try those. Next, we had the edamame dumplings, which is basically steamed won tons filled with pureed edamame in a light miso broth. These were good, not great. For our entree, we ordered the black cod, but we had to send it back because it was so fishy (and undercooked). When I asked the server if the fish is fresh or fresh-frozen, he said, ""Well, they're all fresh-frozen."" Their fish entrees are $22, which seems inexpensive, but they're fairly small portions. For that kind of price in this type of restaurant, I would expect fresh fish. Perhaps the fresh-frozen fish is a cost-cutting measure in what seems to be the increasingly corporate Sam Fox empire. We went with the salmon instead, which was also undercooked but far less fishy. The roasted apples and pureed celery root were lovely, but the dish as a whole was a little overpowered by the mustard sauce, and the accompanying vegetables were weird. Prices overall are very reasonable, especially if you stick with appetizers, salads, pizzas, and sandwiches. True Food aims for the lofty goal of making great cuisine that just so happens to be extremely healthy, and occasionally misses the mark, but I give them credit for bringing Dr. Andrew Weil's philosophies on the importance of nutrition for the body and mind to the mainstream.",0,0,0,10.5,"Positive","5"

Parker House rolls, sweet and salty, an open-face meatloaf sandwich with mushroom gravy. There's a surf board and a tiki carving amidst the flowers. But wait - something's wrong!! There's no humidity! Those are imported mushrooms in my gravy! I work to orient myself in time and space and find, what a relief, that I'm actually in Cafe ZuZu in downtown Scottsdale and it's 2010.

 The Valley Ho Resort, which houses the Cafe, is such a wonderful period piece. It opened in 1956 and was renovated in 2005 by a very wise design team that left the mid-century architecture and spirit intact. Cafe ZuZu is at the far end of the lobby, and its charming patio is surrounded with flowers. The decor is late 50's. If you're as old as we are, you'll recognize it instantly. The menu consists of ""Flavorful American comfort food. Familiar favorites with a contemporary twist."" There are goodies like warm Maytag blue cheese fondue ($7.50), truffled grilled cheese ($9), beef stroganoff ($17), and (gross) tuna salad with cottage cheese which brings me back to my childhood a little too clearly.

 While waiting for our entrees, we received a basket of Parker House rolls. These are the nice squishy white bread treats that, if you can manage not to eat them all, make wonderful toys. You can mold them into sculptures, or shape them into little round beebees to shoot through your straw. My meatloaf sandwich ($11.25) was served on a thick piece of grilled white bread topped first with melty cheese, then the meatloaf, then the gravy. There was a mound of lumpless mashed potatoes alongside. They were so smooth Ken wondered if they were made from instant, but they tasted much too good for that. The portion was huge, I took half home (of course I knew I was going to have dessert). Ken had sauteed liver, beautifully prepared, atop a mound of kale that had been cooked with high quality bacon, sauced with a Madera reduction. He loved it. I surprised him by ordering a lemon meringue tart ($6) for us to share. There were several chocolate desserts that sounded good, but I had a vision of the mile high meringue toppings of my childhood. The tart had only modest swirls of meringue, but it had been made in such a way that it was creamy, as opposed to foamy, and it was really good.The lemon custard was the star. I remembered a gelatinous filling, but this was smooth and velvety, with just the right tart/sweet balance. The pastry was a cross between cookie and pie crust, and stood up well to the filling.

 This was not an inexpensive meal, but the portions are large and quality is excellent. Plus we had joined an organization called The Lunch Club, which every weekday, emails it's members a discount coupon for a restaurant in their specified zip code. So one of our entrees was free! (The discount coupons differ, some are 20% off the bill, others merely are for a free drink). But, to pay Cafe ZuZu the ultimate compliment - I'd come here and pay full price.",1,1,2,10.5,"Positive","5"

There's no creativity there. The Habenaro Salsa is flavorless and not hot at all. Seriously? I asked for HOT, not some yellowish tomato concoction for the people who can't handle real salsa!  At least Chipotle has hot salsa (not too hot either but much better) for a fast Americanized mexican food. Of course I much rather have the real deal but I do like Chiptole for what it is. Not this crap that Qdoba tries to serve up. 
The chicken is over seasoned and highly spiced/herbed you can barely taste the chicken. The Fajita veggie were the same. The product looked of very low quality. Oxidizing Guacamole and Lettuce. The meat looked unappetizing as well. Just not at the level of Chipotle. Although I have been here twice, this is the last time for me.

I came here with a couple of friends really excited to try the only sushi restaurant in DT open for dinner.  There has been some good review on the place and I wanted to give it a chance...I should have gone north to Hana or Yasu!
Walking in, I noticed the decor was another warehouse looking restaurant trying to be modern...only thing is , its not.  From the neon lights under bar to the wood paneling to the tin like tables, chairs, and barstools...its been done 30 times over.  I wish it had more character, a little bit more distinctive.  We are in the art district.  I don't want to walk in a restaurant that looks similar to ones that are already open in the same area?  Okay enough with that, the artist in me is rambling again..sorry..back to the ""food"" review.

Food:  The menu to me was a little confusing.  For being a Sushi joint, it had so many other things also, mostly stirfry items.  I decided to stick to what I came here to try, sushi.  I ordered squid salad to start.  I should not have ordered that to start.  The salad was so salty and it was drowning in dressing...bad start...I then ordered some sashimi including saba, sweet shrimp, and of course my favorite toro.  I was a little disappointed that they did not have uni..how can you not have uni! 
Saba...not bad...
Sweet Shrimp....foul tasting
Toro.....couldn't even bite through it
A good sushi joint has to have fresh fish...good sushi needs to be executed by a sushi chef with good knife skills...simple as that..
When your fish is not that fresh and your sushi chef fish slicing techniques are not there, you have a losing combo.

My friend out of frustration had the head chef make us something...He brought out the geisha roll.
Spicy tuna is not my thing but out of courtesy, we did ask him to pick, I tried it..it was ok, again I am not too keen on chopped up tuna, which in this case tasted like it was food processed.  A little too mushy..

Drinks:
Beers: Been done.  Infused vodkas: Been done Cocktails: Been done.

Good Points:  Nice staff, cool Teapots, and clean restrooms

All in all, I guess I was hoping for a sushi joint that was more innovative and creative with equally good skills to execute.  Maybe I am too harsh.  Or maybe I am just saying it how it is...As I left the joint, I felt like I have been to a sushi restaurant like that so many times before...

(The convenience store packages just were not doing it for me!) After checking out the website, I emailed good friends in Las Vegas (who used to live in Minnesota), asking if they were familiar with Von Hanson's.  (They have 21 locations in Minnesota - and ONE in Chandler.)

My roommate and I went on July 2. They were running a special for NY strips - buy one, get one free - so that was added to the plan in addition to the jerky.SCORE!  We picked up a half pound each of the peppered jerky and the cajun spicy.  $18/lb.  The NY strips were (if memory serves...) $14.99/lb, and the steaks were averaging a little over 3/4 lb - so super yay for the BOGO sale - it brought the meat down to regular grocery prices. I have to say - the quality of the meat is amazing!  Just looking at the cuts in the display case, I can declare Von Hanson's makes AJ's look like Fry's!  These were GORGEOUS!  Quite possibly the prettiest steaks I've ever seen!I also grabbed a couple pigs ears for my dog, and the roommate picked up a package of her favorite kind of sausage (linguisa).

Admittedly, I am not a sausage expert.  Plus, I live very close to Schreiner's - so while I would have no problem buying sausage from Von Hanson's, I wouldn't make the hike to Chandler just for those.  The selection was quite impressive, though!

Overall - this place has everything for carnivorial happiness!  (Hey - if you understood the context, it's a word, right?)  Great selection of beef, chicken and pork products.  Tons of spices, sauces, rubs and marinades.  Nice selection of unique beer and wines.  Fridge and freezer cases with more meats, sides, and desserts! Yes, it's pricey - but the quality is certainly there to justify it.

Once home, we grilled up the steaks using our favorite rub.  OMG amazing meat!  Probably the best steak I've had in YEARS - and NY strip isn't even my cut of choice!

The peppered beef jerky is full of YUM - and this is so strange to write - but the Cajun is a bit spicy for my taste.  (And I adore spicy!)  It's amazingly good, and addictive - but almost requires a cold beer to go along with it to help cut the heat.

The Vegas via Minnesota friends emailed back Monday - they know Von Hanson's quite well - and are grateful there isn't one in Vegas - it would KILL the weekly grocery budget with how often they'd be in!  They love, love, LOVE the place - and I am now under strict orders to bring them care packages from here whenever I come up to visit!

Situated right next door to Sun Devil Liquors, I'm surprised I hadn't been there before, or, for that matter, even noticed it.  I guess when I hit SDL, I've got tunnel vision.  First thing I notice is there appears to be plenty of parking, even at 12:30, for lunch.  Outer patio, stuck out into the parking lot, not overly appealing, might be nicer in the evening, I guess?  The interior is clean, plenty of seating, a small bar at one end, and a counter from which you place your order.  Never having been before, I ask the counter-person for a recommendation.  ""What's good?""  He suggests the Original Gyro, served with fries or a greek salad.  Sounds good, I'll take it with fries.  With drink, under $9.  A few moments later (actually, I saw three other tables get served, so it seemed like a longish wait), a ginormous gyro arrives, with a huge helping of fries.  The gyro was huge, overflowing with, umm, meat, gyro meat, I guess, white onions, diced tomatoes and cucumber sauce (Tzatziki, I think).  The meat was well cooked, artfully shaved, and tender.  The sauce was also very good.  The pita?  Warm, soft and tasty.  The fries? Crisp and golden brown, and piping hot, about 3-4 times the size of Mickie D's or about 1/2 a 'steak fry'.  I was very impressed with the quality of the food, the cleanliness of the dining area, and the presence of a bar.  Most folks were eating gyros, or good sized greek salads.

I was impressed, but not blown away.  Everything I tasted was quite competent, but if I had to choose a word to describe the menu, I would suggest ""staid.""  Perhaps even ""stodgy,"" but that may be more harsh than I intend.

Review the dinner menu.  http://bit.ly/aWqVVJ.  There, see what I mean?  Replete with Traditional American entrees and sides, at what I would consider fairly exorbitant prices.  I would say that I wouldn't go back to eat this food at these prices, unless someone else was paying.  

I should note that a big part of why I wasn't impressed is because this place is simply not my style.  The wait staff, attired in khakis and blue shirts, was a little too informal for the prices we were paying, I felt.  The menu options were a little boring for my taste.  The cocktail menu is exactly not what I'm looking for these days, although I will be very interested to see what Happy Hour looks like.  The decor is a tad heavy on the Old Southwest theme, although to be fair, this place not only pulls it off rather stylishly but also is among the most authentically old and southwestern establishments in the Phoenix metro area.  

The patio and open bar are fantastic.  The bar area is considerable, and the patio is palatial - up above Lincoln Dr enough to be fairly quiet, with a gorgeous view of Camelback, sunset here must be incredible.  

Anyway, back to the food.  Everything was very well executed, from the sticky buns we were served upon being seated to the desserts we ordered.  I chose the soup of the day to start, a tomato/basil concoction that was quite hearty and thoroughly enjoyed it.  The salads my dining companions ate looked boring to me, but they all claimed them to be excellent, with ""the best Caesar dressing ever"" and ""polenta croutons?!?"" being the verdict for the Caesar salad, at least.  On to the entrees.  I ordered the crispy duck, which I found to be delicious and quite hearty, though not what I would call crispy by any means.  It was a very sizable portion, and very well prepared.  My dining companions ordered the pork chop, the lamb, and the salmon, and we each sampled from each other's plates.  I would try the lamb if I went back, but the consensus seemed to be that everything was very well prepared, with the duck being a winner.  It was served with a heap of mushy sweet potatoes (just like my mom makes at Thanksgiving - delicious!) and red cabbage, which I sampled and declined to finish.  Again, not quite my style.  

We moved on to dessert - sticky bread pudding with a bourbon glaze and the warm chocolate cake.  The bread pudding was a winner at the first two or three bites, but grew one-dimensional as I continued nibbling at it.  The chocolate cake was decadent, among the best I've ever tasted.  It was clearly made with a considerable amount of dark chocolate, which seals the deal for me.  And in case you were wondering, my dining companions apparently have no stamina when it comes to dessert.  Suckers.  

Anyway, as I've said now several times, this place is just not quite me.  It's totally classy and very high in quality, but not quite adventurous enough for my taste.  I'd love to come back for brunch, and once they unveil their happy hour menu, I'm sure I'll be back to check it out, but I won't be back for dinner unless I can convince someone else to pick up the check at the end of the evening.  

As a side note, this place is so very Paradise Valley.  It's a welcome relief knowing that there is a place that is so anti-scene out there.  It's been a little while since I've been both the youngest and among the poorest in a room, and I will say it was a little comforting.  Just don't tell the Scottsdale people about this place, and we'll all be happy.",14,18,9,15,"Positive","4"

I've said it before, I'll say it again: if you don't like a lot of frosting, just wipe off the portion you don't want. Heck, if you're sitting next to me and my kids, they'll eat it for you!!

I didn't think I was much of an frosting fan either so I wiped off most from the Chocolate Chip Caramel, only to find that the milk chocolate frosting covered with a caramel drizzle was UH-MAZING! Scraped that heap right back in my mouth where it belongs! Yum. Equally impressive it the dense, moist cake (as opposed to light and fluffy texture; these puppies are HEAVY). The White Chocolate Raspberry was chock-full of white chocolate chips and the frosting was not too sweet. It was the prettiest one as well, with white sprinkles and raspberry sauce drizzle. Thoroughly enjoyed the two other chocolate selections (Texas Milk Chocolate & Midnight Magic) as well--Yes! I had four, but only cut them in half so I could save the rest for (my husband) later.

These lectures cover focused overviews on topics ranging from Genetics and Nanotechnology to Native American medicinal utilization of native plants found in the Southwest. 

There is always interesting science or engineering content but the value and interest of the talks is essentially the somewhat direct non-mass-media poisoned or dumbed down views of the individual speakers themselves. While I would attend the talks regardless I have found additional value in the evening because of the extended hours that the science center offers which allows you to catch an IMAX film and see the latest flavor of exhibit (Body Worlds, Titanic, etc.) after the lecture. 

I would have loved to have given the Science Center 4 stars but I am constantly annoyed by the science center's staff inability to get one of the three microphones set up correct for the speakers ahead of time causing a speaker to waste 5-10 minutes every month.

Beer and wine are available for purchase during the event. The adult's night out lectures are free, normal planetarium, IMAX, and special exhibit prices still apply.

-Elizabeth Rozin, Primal Cheeseburger

Who could argue with that statement? Checked out Delux Burger today; Delux is a burger joint that gets some serious buzz and numerous Best Burger awards from the local media. They are also a late night favorite since they serve food until 2 AM. This gives them street credit in my opinion.

The mystery dining companion, otherwise known as L. joined me for this burger excursion this evening; we arrived around 10:00 PM for a late supper. The seating is a bit cramped in the dining room and the patio. The Delux menu is very nicely limited, meeting my personal rule for just do what you do best. We both ordered the signature entree, the ""Delux Burger""($9.5), starring a half-pound of freshly ground Harris Ranch beef; supporting cast includes a toasted demi baguette topped with Maytag and Gruyère cheeses, sweet caramelized onions, applewood smoked bacon and organic arugula. We also ordered the Combination Fries ""a la cart"" ($6) which came out before the Burgers. The fries were fantastic! They were served in a mini shopping cart (making them easy to share) and included french and sweet potato fries. Two sauces were also included with the fries, a standard ketchup and a house aioli which resembled a thousand island type sauce with some kick. 

The burgers came out shortly after the fries. They were impressive looking before we took the first bite - robust in size and the beef was perfectly cooked. Delux recommends to order their burgers at medium rare allowing them to showcase the juiciness of the beef; L. and I ordered our burgers medium and they were prepared perfectly. As we bit into these works of art, the beefy goodness oozed wonderful flavor onto our palate. The beef truly is the star of this show, however supporting cast complements it nicely without taking away from the magnificent flavor of the beef. This burger really hit the spot.

I was able to command and conquer this burger, however L. was only able to master one half and took the other half home. Adam from Man Vs. Food would have been so disappointed with her. A few other good factors that Delux offers: Good service, fantastic beer selection, which are primarily microbrews from across the country, and reasonable prices. If Delux has a weakness, it's an atmosphere that's a bit trendy and possibly even slightly pretentious, but the burgers are so good that it's overruled.

Last Saturday a group of friends went out for a friend's birthday celebration in Scottsdale and decided if we split up that we would meet at the end of the night at Loco Patron. It was increasingly obvious that the staff was hostile and irritated that they could not close up early. We finished our last call drinks and started to head out. The friend who was celebrating his birthday waited behind at the bar until his friends left the bathroom. At this point two bouncers became extremely agitated at our friend and demanded that he put down his drink and leave. My friend started to explain his reason for not leaving (friends still in bathroom) but was quickly cut off. I watched from the patio as the two bouncers (both obviously larger in height and weight then my friend) quickly escalate from talking to both grabbing my friend under the arms and start to carry him out. As he was carried backwards he lost his balance and tumbled back with both bouncers on top of him. The bouncers slammed him down headfirst on the cement outside of the establishment, pinned him down with their elbows and hit him. At this point I had run behind the bouncers and was yelling at them to get off of him. I had already taken out my phone to call 911 and I quickly tried to take a picture to show that they were using excessive force. We demanded to see the manager at which point the bouncer said he was the manager and refused our request. He swiped my friend's phone down out of his hand and broke it on the ground. Several people had called 911 at this point and we waited outside for the police to arrive. The police arrived and took down the bouncers' information and stated that they would be recording this incident.

 I am absolutely adamant in saying that neither I nor my friends will ever frequent Loco Patron again. We were treated disrespectfully by untrained staff who were either too eager to close up to get home or get a power high by manhandling non threatening, non physical patrons of their establishment. Based on the behavior of the two bouncers I assume that this bar operates without any written guidelines on how bouncers should conduct themselves. What I witnessed was full on assault and an infringement on human rights and I plan on writing any regulatory agency I can think of.

The servings are HUGE for what you're paying...shucks, they are huge no matter which way you look at it so be careful not to order too much food unless you want leftovers. Who doesn't like leftover Chinese food anyway?

My recommendations are the Sweet and Sour chicken, the Egg Foo Yung and the chow mein. You will not be disappointed.

You'll also find the soups on the back of the menu at an average of 4 bucks or so. You will be pleasantly surprised when you get the bowl...it can feed at least 6 people. She will bring small bowls out and serve it for you right at the table. Give the hot and sour soup a try.

As for the service, it depends on how you look at it. Don't be afraid to get up and refill your own water. Shoot, the waitress is the only one that's there, give her a break already. She must own the joint with her husband because there is always this little kid in the corner playing on his laptop. So, get your own water and your own take home containers if you want. She doesn't have a problem with it.

Yes, the place is a little worn but you don't go there to look at pretty stuff. It's not dirty, just broke down. You'd be broke down too if you practically gave away your food in abundance to your customers. Who has money for new furniture if you take care of your customers bellies.  The lobster, crab and fish are fresh and cheap. Try finding lobster somewhere else in the valley for 10 bucks a pound, I dare ya. 

So, head on out, just don't go on a Wednesday, that's their day off. They are open 11AM to 11PM every other day though. You can call in your order and pick it up if you don't want to look at the place.

Oh yeah, and if you ever go in there and it smells horrid, it's not the place, it's a popular dish that some customers order called ""Salty Fish"". It stinks to all heck! If that plate comes out I usually pack up my food, giggle and finish my meal at home. I don't mind one bit, that's just the way it is.

I love seeing restaurants crop up in that part of town that aren't just catering to the bar scene and making the food an afterthought. My girlfriend and I made reservations for Friday night expecting Bernie Kantak's new restaurant to be packed. Much to our surprise when we arrived, the place was pretty dead with tons of open tables. We purposely arrived early to enjoy a cocktail at the bar and even though we could have been seated right away, we pressed forward with our original plan.

At the bar, I ordered my usual cocktail while the GF ordered a sangria off their cocktail menu. We also ordered an order of the bacon fat heirloom popcorn from the bar snacks menu. My cocktail was perfectly made and my GF loved the sangria. The popcorn took forever to come out, but when it was delivered they also brought out an order of the calamari compliments of the chef. The popcorn was a little bit burned and we both thought it could have used some salt, which was surprising since we thought the bacon fat would have provided that flavor. The calamari was perfectly cooked and not greasy in the least. I enjoyed the pickled fennel on the side, but my GF isn't a fan of fennel, so she didn't try it.

After we finished our cocktails at the bar, we moved to a table for the main event. In an unusual move for us, we skipped wine and stuck with beer and cocktails, but I did eye some good finds on the concise wine list. For our appetizer, we ordered the sausage of the day, which was a beef based sausage with a cabbage casing. It was very unique and we both really enjoyed it. For our main courses, the GF ordered the AZ B.L.T. and ordered the Pork Tender Loin. The B.L.T. had tons of perfectly crispy bacon on it, but we both agreed that it was really good , but not great overall. The Pork Tender Loin, on the other hand, was excellent in my opinion. I loved the figs and the sweet potato-chevre strudel. Of course, you could put chevre on anything and I would like it.

When it was time for dessert, we knew that we had to try some of Tracy Dempsey's latest creations. We normally split dessert, but decided to each get our own. The GF got the cookies and milk and I had the chocolate toffee bread pudding. The cookies are delivered in a bag that you can take home, which is great because you probably won't down the generous serving of cookies in one setting  unless you're sharing. My GF was quite happy to take home a little bag of cookies to enjoy later. My bread pudding was awesome and I wish I could have purchased a gallon of the Maker's Mark ice cream to take home with me. I'll definitely be craving this dessert in the future.

The atmosphere of the restaurant is a little austere, even for my taste. It just seems like they could a little bit to make it a little bit more warm and inviting. Service, while extremely friendly, was a little bit uneven throughout the night starting with the snacks at the bar taking a long time and continuing with confusion over what tables plates should be delivered to. Keep in mind the restaurant has been open for only a week, so these are things that can be worked out.

We were really surprised to see the restaurant so empty on a Friday night, so I hope more people give it a try. Citizen is a really good neighborhood restaurant that has the potential to be great. We look forward to trying it again to see how it improves and evolves. I'm really hoping it's a successful staple in Old Town for years to come.",0,2,0,11.5,"Positive","4"

The restaurant was very clean and I enjoyed the music playing, but I think it could use a little more color in the dining room. I was greeted upon entering and was asked if I had been here before. The waiter was very friendly and took the time to explain some of the dishes to me. I asked about the pof pof and he explained that they are like donuts, but better. I passed on them. I ordered the jerk steak over jolof rice, a meat patty, and plantains. First came out the meat patty. The pastry tasted like cornmeal to me, and not flakey like I had hoped. The filling was quite good and just enough spice without going overboard. The steak was very tender and flavorful, with a little bit of heat. For the price, you get your money's worth and I'll have enough left-overs for tomorrow's lunch. Before leaving, the waiter gave me a complimentary pof pof, and in my opinion, it was better than a donut.

I'll definitely be going there again.

We moved but I had always considered this my home church. When we moved back to AZ I started again and was really disappointed with the young adults ministry and praise and worship. I left when I wasn't getting anything out of it and not much longer did they join with City Church. I think they are struggling but I have hope for them. Pastor Terry is the new head pastor and he has the Joel Osteen vibe, which isn't for me, but he is very nice. 

They are non- denominational and love their congregation enough to handle sins or situations other churches don't want to touch in fear of being labeled as 'haters' or what not. I hope that anyone who attends will understand their views do not come from hate. It makes me sad that the other reviewer had such a negative experience and I don't doubt that she wasn't treated with kindess as every church seems to have those rude people. I am not sure what she means by 'closed-minded' but I know there are people like that at every church. I hope others do not have that experience and I hope the church can work on that as a whole. people need to feel welcome and accepted as they are. 

They are also awesome with the community- homeless outreaches, drug addiction help, and so many things I cannot begin to list. If you ever want to help your community City of Grace would be a great place to get ideas of where/how you can help. 

 If pastor Terry isn't for you I would recommend Cornerstone Chandler(my home church) or Central Christian. They are not closed-minded but they also won't ignore sins that are major issues.

It's not as hyped as Grayhawk, Troon, and some other courses but it's just as great of a layout, if not better than some of the more popular high-end courses in the valley (definitely better than the overrated Grayhawk). The course has the rare distinction of being very playable yet very challenging at the same time. You'll be toast if you don't hit it fairly straight on most holes, but you won't be punished for hitting it where you intended like some of the blind-shot-heavy courses (i.e. We-Ko-Pa) here in the valley. I've shot in the 70s one day and in the 90s the next out there.

Besides the superb and scenic layout, I also like the simplicity of the overall complex. It's not at a big resort, there aren't multiple courses, and there is no grand clubhouse (not that all those things are always bad). It's just the 18 holes, pro shop, and a restaurant that serves up some pretty solid food. The staff is friendly and helpful, too. It's like a neighborhood course albeit a high-end one. 

They have some great summer rates for locals this summer: Any day, any time for only $35. I recommend all valley golfers to enjoy that rate while it lasts. I played yesterday and the course was in good shape tee-to-green, and outstanding shape on the greens. It's been awhile since I've seen greens roll this well on a $35 course here in town.

One last, but important, note: It gets WINDY out here. As in, it gets windy every day. The course plays through a canyon and the winds are swirling all the time.

This is traditional Italian-American fare, rich and flavorful- with big portions. The Chicken Piccata is crack-good. It's served in what I've come to learn is a Sicilian style, with a n awesome relish of tomatoes, capers, and green olives and a side of addictive Fett Alfredo. It never gets old.

Another great authentic dish is their Cecca- you can get it as a ""Pie"" (Pizza, that is) or over pasta. You just have try it. It's rich, refreshing, and explosively flavorful all at once.

The house salad is a variation on a traditional AntiPasto theme- and is a meal, and event, in and of its self.

I really didn't care about price at the time with the coupon.

The plates of our food were still in front us the entire time and we had kind of placed them all together so that she could come and just take them...kind of thought that the bunch of plates stacked together would give the hint we were done but I guess I shouldn't be so subtle next time.

It's tucked away on a side street in a humble looking home cum art gallery cum bar. It can be a little tricky to find since no sign exists, so keep an eye out for the neon lit open sign. You definitely don't want to miss out on this place by becoming frustrated after fruitlessly ducking down side streets, saying fuck it and going to The Roosevelt. While it wouldn't be a total bust, you'd be missing out on the warm and inviting ambiance of the Lost Leaf.

That's really what won me over about this bar. It made me feel downright cozy, with exposed brick and wood, local artist's artwork decorating the walls, and the actual kitchen serving as the bar. The main room is large enough to host a large group, but small enough to be homey. The acoustics are very good (soft talkers rejoice!) and the music playing was loud enough to add to the mood, but nowhere near the point of drowning out conversation. There are a couple rooms in addition to the main bar area that you can duck off into for more intimate conversation, as well as an outdoor patio that's a little on the small side but, super score--there's ceiling fans!

I found the prices to be very reasonable and the service to be unpretentious and helpful. There are no beers on tap here, but the selection of bottles is mind bogglingly extensive. I had to ask the bartender to get me his favorite pale beer and I ended up finding out that I am also in love with a brew called 1664. Looks like a wine cooler, but manages to be respectable instead of laughable.

I never once read a menu that I wanted to try everything on here. They had a huge variety of dishes at what I can only describe as American/French fusion. It all looked so divine. And from what I've been told, their menu changes frequently to new seasonal dishes. So I can't wait to see what they offer when I return. I went simple with my meal having this delicious quiche, fresh fruit and a cup of their corn chowder soup. The soup was so rich and creamy, I could have ordered and ate a whole trough! It was that good. The fruit was clean, well portioned and fresh. I'm very particular with fruit, and hate when the fruit looks soggy and overly ripened. And the quiche was heavenly as well.

However, living in Phoenix and Scottsdale, we decided to go to the Fountain Hills location. Plus, another friend lives there so it was a more central location for all of us. 

We arrived around 7 and it wasn't crowded at all, we got a table right away. We got chips and salsa to start which was perfect since I was really hungry with it being way past my dinner time. One of the girls got a pomegranate margarita and she said that it was really sweet but good. I got the fish tacos and they were delicious. Probably the best fish taco I've had. I was expecting some sort of fried fish, probably cod. I was pleasantly surprised that it was grilled and the two tacos came wrapped up in the foil pouch they were cooked in. It also had this really good sauce. The hard shell tacos that my friends got also looked really good. The shell looks homemade, fried, and super crispy. My friend asked for extra cheese which they brought out in a small dipping bowl. She was also charged extra for this. The tacos didn't come with that much cheese to begin with, so that's kind of a rip-off. The price isn't that cheap either, I would definitely say it's on the pricey side.  

The atmosphere was just okay. I was reading how it's the most romantic location, etc. but maybe they're just referring to the Cave Creek location. All of the employees were nice and even took a group photo of us at the end since my friends were visiting from all over.

But, alas, if the old Mimi's quality still existed, they wouldn't have exceeded my expectations for WHAT NOT to experience in a restaurant.

Let me recant why YOU or ANY ONE ELSE (except those people you truly dislike) should never patronize this facility.  First of all, the interior temperature was at least 80 degrees (when it was less than 65 outside).  We had to ask for the air conditioning to be turned on.

Next, we ordered the artichoke dip appetizer.  It looked funny.  It tasted funny.  The tortilla chips actually resembled pita chips.  If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck, it must be a ______.

Hubby and I ordered the same thing, 2 meat combo (brisket and baby back ribs) with double grilled veggies--extra grilled.  For some reason, we both got the same thing, sometimes that happens.  

First, we got our cornbread, which is always so delicious.  They serve it with butter, but you don't really need it.  Our meals came quickly (we didn't order appetizers), so we dug right in.  The brisket, as usual, melted in my mouth.  It's probably one of the best places I've ever been for brisket, and that's saying something.  I always order it wherever we go.  Also, my husband is NOT a brisket eater, but he will order it here.  Now for the ribs, I need to let you know, I'm a sweet & savory BBQ fan, definitely not spicy.  I've had the ribs before, and they were always sweet and tender, plus they literally fall off the bone.  These were like they usually are, fall off the bone and tender.  But, there seemed to be a spicier rub on them, which was a little off-putting to me.  Even my husband mentioned it, and he doesn't mind a little heat.  Neither one of us remember them tasting that way.  I dipped them in the sweet BBQ sauce, and that seemed to cool the spice a bit, and I did eat them all, but I'm not sure I'd get them again.  And, lastly, the grilled veggies, which consist of green peppers, zucchini, squash, onion and mushrooms--wonderful!!  I love the charred grill taste, and I gently dip them in the sauce.  I really adore them!

We rarely get dessert, because we're so full.  We have taken some cobbler home before, but it's never quite the same as having it fresh from the kitchen.  Plus, they bring you each a fresh mini sugary doughnut with your bill.  These are the perfect finish to a very good BBQ meal.  They bring them to you in a bag, but to be honest, they've never made it out the door.

"8503","UrANiXCSUMVLQ9CVzPdyYg","5","After weeks of anticipation, Side Bar has finally opened.  As you ascend the staircase to the second level, the reason for the long wait becomes apparent.  The attention to detail is amazing.  Once layered with crumbling plaster, the walls were meticulously stripped to reveal the historic brickwork.  Other historic elements include the original steel casement windows that feature a view of downtown phoenix and the surrounding area. Tastefully integrated with these elements is a contemporary interior design.  The lighting consists of warm colors that set the stage for the laid back atmosphere.  No expense was spared when designing the bar and tables, which are made of dark exotic woods.  Seating included organically shaped bar stools that adjust to a comfortable height and depth.  There are also several u-shaped sofas that create conversational areas.  Behind the bar you'll see an array of artistically arranged circular openings backlit in a warm, yellow tone.  Thick glass shelving lines the back wall along with a fine assortment of liquors.  The ""soft opening"" menu included wines and locally brewed beers among others.  I tried a White Russian and my wife had a glass of Chardonnay.  Both were very good.  Prices seemed to be close to average for the area and when compared to the experience, were a good value.  I had a chance to speak to one of the owners who was glowing with excitement.  After two years of remodeling and working with the city and adjacent historic neighborhood, his vision has become reality.  In addition to a brief history of his endeavor, the owner informed me that additional overflow parking will be available adjacent to the main parking lot.  Parking was one concern originally voiced by the neighborhood and city.  The owners may also experiment with weekly art showings by local artists.  Maybe they can arrange for it to coincide with First Fridays.  Within walking distance of Side Bar, dining includes Pei Wei, My Florist, and Zoe's Kitchen.

This is at the cost often of not allowing the original beauty of the cuisine to be savoured by all. In fact, my visit to the Indian Paradise was not without some sarcasm and pessimism on my part given that so many places in the area get it wrong when it comes to this genre.  
Boy, was I wrong!  Don't let the fascade of the place fool you.  When you enter, it takes a few seconds to smell the fact that you are going to have the genuine article here.  If you go at lunch time, you can experience the buffet.  I went on a Sunday afternoon and the place was perfectly poised for a sunset dining experience.
ALL the food...from the nan to the lamb curry, to the tea, to the samosas to the califlower....EVERYTHING was really good.  But I have to also add that there was a certain family-like atmosphere created by the staff and the service was unassuming yet intuitive.  I found that I did not want to leave.  I just wanted to stay here and talk and snack a little.  That's kind of hard to achieve in a strip mall restaurant yet, this did not feel like that.

And they do great mac and cheese. Some better than others- my favorite so far has actually been the spinach and pesto. If you want the chorizo, I say pass. The spinach or the bacon is much better. If you're into bleu cheese, the bleu cheese mac is VERY bleu. Take that for what it's worth. 

That's not all they do either. Their entrees are consistently great. My boyfriend got some scallops that were incredible, though I don't think it's on their menu now.

Their wines are great too. I'll be honest, I'm no connoisseur, but they had a moscato from Israel that the bf still drools over. It's enough that the next time I was there I picked up a whole bottle, just for him. I've also had one of their mojitos and that was great as well.

As a note- if you're in for happy hour and get a cheese plate... I really do think its better to splurge and get a regular cheese plate. I got a happy hour cheese plate, and it's... miniscule. All of the stuff that made their non happy hour cheese plate awesome was diminished. 1 cheese instead of 3. No boursin. Fewer crackers. Less of that fantastic orange blossom honey and apples.

The location is perfect; right at the intersection of Guadalupe & Greenfield.  Parking is no problem.  The walk from car to water is little more than a skip, hop and a jump.  Very easy for my elderly dad to take my son fishing.  

The fishing is easy too.  The pond is stocked with Trout, Bass, Catfish and Sunfish.  We've been catching nice trout (10-12 inches, Yum!) using nightcrawlers.  I'm keep hearing that white power bait works too.  Although the bottom of the pond seems to have several rocks, snags don't ever seem to be a problem.  Maybe best of all, the edge of the pond is a cement curbed sidewalk.  Like I said, Jethro Bodine would be right at home.  I suppose if you are gonna be an ""Urban Fisherman"" you might as well do it right!

Not much into fishing?  No problem.  There is a wonderful library with windows looking out over the pond.  There are paths for a nice walk.  There are birds everywhere.  There is even some kind of observatory (haven't checked it out yet, don't know the details).

No, it's not an extremely enlightened idea. I've been sneaking Bacardi into theaters since 2003 so it's about time theaters realize they should probably attempt to turn a profit off of it, but AMC really upped the game by not only providing me the option of purchasing alcoholic beverages from THEM, but also upgraded chairs, and a ton of delicious food (Including the obligatory $4 box of candy which is hilarious sitting next to a $9 burger. Like ""Don't mind this $9 full meal over here, we still stand firm that Gummi Bears are worth their weight in gold."")

Yes, it's more expensive than a regular ticket. Almost double for the nice seats. But trust me, YOU WANT THOSE SEATS. You will regret not getting the $15 seats if you don't buy the $15 seats so just pony up the cash and delight in the fact that movie theaters are now almost as comfortable as watching a movie in your own home. 

This theater is so nice it even makes bad movies tolerable.

But what fun was this!

A girl friend took initiative here to organize a kitchen tea on a recent Saturday afternoon. We were a table of 6 girl friends that were scheduled for some pottery making! 

My initial idea of this venue was admittedly a little different but better than expected in so many ways!

For one we did not have to get all that dirty. Not dirty at all really. Also not that I mind dirty. This is for those who wonder whether to go or not to go.

And two - we were able to bring along our own food and drinks which made for excellent responsibility sharing in the wining and dining arena.

Once we were set up with our party arrangements and have had some snacks and champagne we were inspired to start our artistic journey. The idea was to have each of the 6 friends make a dinner plate (or item of the bride to be's choice) which we will then give to her as a wedding present. I thought this idea was really original.

So the bride to be selected her dinner plates of choice after which we were briefed by a very friendly and sweet staff member as to the different effects that the paint will have once the plates were baked. All informed we went to select the different colors we needed for our different art works.

Everybody started painting and each one of us got really involved with their own creation. The event took us much longer than we anticipated but in such a good way. We finished about 4 hours after starting off but much enlightened by the activity.

Everybody agreed that we will have to go here again for the sheer enjoyment and good feeling of togetherness it promoted. I have not yet seen the end product as one of our friends went to pick up our designs - but we will presenting our collective gift to the bride to be soon :)

Firstly it's gorgeous (comes in rows of the ingredients which are beautiful colors; arugula, tomatoes, pepitas, dried currents, chicken, asiago cheese, and dried corn for some crunch)  Then when it gets to your table they pour on the dress (a creamy dressing with a slight basil taste to it), and it all gets mixed together.  

I believe it usually comes with salmon instead of chicken but we ordered ours with chicken and it was a great fit, I highly suggest it.

"8654","OQhXgCGbH3W6kS9q-_DusQ","1","One hour. That is how long we waited after ordering before we decided we would rather eat anywhere that wasn't here. A crushing, impressively underwhelming experience in lack of service.

We arrived, found we had free valet parking? With a teensy parking lot, this works, thank you. A good selection of indoor and outdoor seating? Also a plus. Setting expectations and/or taking care of waiting customers? FAIL.

On a beautiful AZ autumn morning we came here (tho we entered Rockerij). We asked to be re-seated outside because inside of Rockerij is dark as a tomb and had loud, conversation intruding, music. We were reseated by the fireplace, and a waiter came over shortly to take our order. Bam. So far so good...or so we thought. 30 Mins after placing our order, I ask another waiter to check on the status of our food and he cleverly asks about what we ordered (exactly)...so we think it is being taken care of. 40 MINS after placing our order, I have still only had my coffee refilled once...and had to flag down another waiter to inquire about the status of our food again, because our actual waiter is nowhere to be found and the previous ""drive-by"" waiter never returned. A few mins beyond that, this guy actually comes back and indicates that our order is nearly ready and should only be a few minutes longer. Shortly thereafter OUR waiter stops by with comments of: 

""I don't know why it's taking so long...""
and
""I put the ticket in right after I took your order...""

So...as a waiter...maybe it might be part of your job to check on the status of an order say...15mins after bringing it by the kitchen? Perchance? What do you think?

FIFTEEN (15 == few?) minutes later, we still had no food and I'd had quite enough. Out the door we went.

On a comical note: As we were outside (another 5 minute wait because the valet had our car either parked in Egypt somewhere or tandem?) our waiter came out to find us to let us know that our food was ready if we'd like to come back inside?

Oh R E A L L Y? The Clue-Delivery Train will be visiting you shortly. Facial cues you may want to look for in the future are:

On July 7, 2011, my date  and I arrived around 6:30 pm, well dressed and ready to enjoy a celebratory dinner without any financial limitations. We would have easily spent $250+.

Instead, after an hour of being seated  to review our menus we were never offered more than a cocktail.

Tables around us were receiving quality attention by other servers...complete with the run down of the specials, house favorites, answering questions, etc. We, on the other hand, were lucky to have our make server look at us, much less take us to the next step our level in our dining experience.

When the table behind us, seated a good 15 mins after us, received bread before we were, my date and I decided that was our tipping point and would not stay any longer.

When our server came to ask if we were ready to order we informed him  we would not be staying for dinner  and would like the bill for the cocktail.

Never once did the server apologize, offer what he could do to make things right, etc. 

Needless to say, we were stunned. The hostess thanked us for dining on our way out...again, we both gritted our teeth with frustration. However, later we discovered that after an hour of sitting in the dining room, we were there long enough to enjoy a meal. It's unfortunate we never got the opportunity to, however.

I have seen a decent number of games here over the years. Most recently I saw a weekend game sitting out on the lawn. It does not get much better than relaxing on the lawn, watching some baseball, hanging out with your friends, and getting some color in the 80 degree heat. 

The practical details: (1) there are a TON of food options. Maybe too many, if you believe in such a thing. Food of all kinds is everywhere. You can get all the standard ball park fare and some more exotic things, too, like noodle dishes, sushi, fry bread, etc. (2) Ticket prices are good - sit up close for 20 bucks on down to the lawn for 6 bucks. You can't beat it for getting up close to the action (3) Parking is only 5 bucks in the lot, which I think is really decent, but if you want to walk a little further you could find street parking across the street.

BEST DEAL IN THE PARK: $9 for a 32oz. soda with unlimited refills. A large one is $5 and not as big, so if you get even two this is a great deal. On the hot day I was there we filled the sucker up three times and once more before we left. Well worth it.

Except, back then, Bosa Donuts was a Taco Bell. A few years back Taco Bell moved a half mile down the road into a new building and Bosa Donuts set up shop. About a year ago I discovered another new store in this strip mall which is Fallout Games, an awesome video game store. For this entire last year I've been driving past Bosa on my way out of the complex after visiting Fallout Games and taking a curious look as I drive by but until this week I had never tried it. After reading all the positive Yelp reviews, I had to give it a go.

Well, first off, It's 24 hours, which is huge in my book since I'm almost always up until four or five in the morning. The drive through display is lighted and shows their menu but you have to actually order by pulling up to the window. Since I was there at 3am I asked what was fresh at the moment and the guy was very patient and helpful with listing off what he had available. I just got a few frosted donuts (or raised, as they call them) and was on my way. Right off the bat, I noticed the box was pretty heavy. I only ordered a half dozen but it felt at least as heavy as it does when I get a dozen at Dunkin Donuts. When I got home, I opened the box and realized their donuts are at least thirty percent bigger than Dunkin Donuts of Krispy Kreme.

Anyway, the donuts are awesome. Best tasting donuts I've ever had. I probably shouldn't make it a habit to come here twice a week, if I want to live past forty, but I'll definitely be stopping by once or twice a month from now on. Hope this place sticks around.",0,0,0,3.5,"Positive","4"

Well, you can fool some of the people some of the time, and today, I was no longer fooled by whatever weird people out there have it in for Double Joy Beads.

Firstly, their Czech seed beads are the cheapest in town.  I'm not even kidding.  I purchased six half tubes and one full for around $10.  The organization thereof leaves something to be desired, but at those prices, browsing should be a joy.  

Their pressed glass and fire polished selections were of average number and price.  

In the Swavorski department, standard bicones, cubes and rounds are not available as singles- only some of the pendant materials, and even then, some come packed two to a bag.  I was a bit vexed by this.  What if someone wants one Baroque for a pendant?

The back sported a nice assortment of findings and stringing materials.  Particularly impressive: a display of natural copper items ready for raiding.  Sales bins occupied the front- some bags currently up for less than a quarter.  

I found the clerk on duty during my visit was more of the hands-off type, but quite personable when I checked out.  

The store itself is a bit hard to find, tucked in a winding strip mall.  It's directly across the street from Arizona Art Supply.  That street is Scottsdale Road, but if you can see the art store from the side where Double Joy abides, you can't be far.",0,0,0,2.5,"Positive","4"

My foodie group saw a write-up of this place in the newspaper so we decided to trek out to Mesa.  It was pretty darn good, especially for the price!

They were out of Guayanes (the newspaper had recommended this arepa) so we ordered three other arepas.  In case you don't know, an arepa is a corn fritter type sandwich.  We had the queso de ano, which appeared to have a salty cheese and potato in it.  It was very yum.  We had reina pepiada arepa, which was  like a mayonaise-y chicken salad with avocado- we didn't care that much for it.  But the Pabellon arepa with fried plantain, shredded beef, and black beans was a hit.

We also had the pabellon plate which was quite yummy with the best fried plantains I've ever had.  Oddly, the rice was a bit hard and dry. The cachapas jamon and queso de mano was a favorite with my fellow foodies- kind of like a pancake sandwich with ham and cheese.  We finished with the quesillo (tastes exactly like flan to me) which was very good.

After my first visit it rocketed into my top five favourite restaurants of all time. They have some top notch food, and the best thing is that it's such a deliciously welcome change from the bottom-feeder's Mexican crap that you see all over Phoenix. The menu is varied and I think I eventually will want to try everything. Appetizers include fried alligator and frog's legs. The main I had today was their Mardi Gras Pasta, which is linguini with tomato, thin-sliced garlic, andouille sausage, crawfish meat, onion and delicious shrimp topped with a really nice creamy sauce. Absolutely delicious. The wife had mahi-mahi with an even NICER sauce, and dirty rice on the side. Although a tiny bit on the pricy side it's definitely worth coming back to. Large open seating (outdoor seating also available), dimly lit, old-style jazz, a large full-service bar and a very quaint outside waiting area with water feature, giant fans etc. The service was also great and both times I've been, the waiters have been very helpful (the first guy told me that if I got the large serving of alligator, to try it 'half-blackened' - a great tip which allowed me to taste both 'styles' of the appetizer). They also have things I've not heard of before like etoufee and opelousas. If my dad didn't live over seven thousand miles away I'd take him here in an instant - he'd absolutely love the place. You will too.

When I first pulled into the parking lot last night I was surprised to see how many empty parking spaces there were. I immediately got excited because normally any restaurant on Bell road any night of the week has a wait. However, when I walked inside I saw a slew of people waiting to be seated. I walked up to the hostess stand and put my name on the list and the hostess did not give me a time quote and when I asked how long it would be she quoted me, ""not too long."" We waited about 15 minutes before being shown to our table which is where the trouble really began. 

Once we were at our table we were quickly greeted by our server (yay) however, she told us she had another table's drink order to get and then she would be back for ours (boo). So we waited for her to take the other two tables drink orders before coming back to take ours. 

After about 10 minutes we got our fountain drinks and then 5 minutes later she came back to take our food order. Then it took about 50 minutes for our food to come out. Seriously, 50 minutes.... that's about how long I planned to spend at Macayo's not how long I planned on waiting for my appetizer of taquitos to take to come out. And to top it off we were missing a side of rice and a side of baja sauce. We decided not to mention it as we did not want to wait another hour for the two items to come out. So, after eating and waiting for our drinks to be refilled 3 times we finally got the check to which the server apologized for our wait. Apparently, she couldn't have apologized at all during our 50 minute minute wait she needed to wait until tip time.

I have now been to Zinc three times, every time I ordered something different, so far the food has not dissapointed as much as the prices have.  Wow.

Okay, okay, you have a spot in Scottdale, it's a nice little posh area with plenty of traffic, designer furniture and nick-nack and artsy stores that typically have things that would require your to take out a 2nd mortgage to afford those things that often just gather dust, one season at a time at home.  You would think someone on that strip would be the one to say, let's have reasonable prices.  Zinc is not one of those.

The restaurant has the name Bistro in it. They have folks dining out on the sidewalk, dining with noise and the occasional smell of BMW exausts...  That's beautiful and very Parisian, also very Bistro.  Here is a wake up call though... Bistros offer fares with decent prices, a prix fixe menu and simply good simple food.  

The prices were incredibly high for what you do get.  Unfortunately the charm of having an outdoor patio and serving fries in fake newspaper doesn't cut it.    The Steak Frites (a hanger steak w/ fries and a brandy sauce) is a French Bistro Classic, a staple if you will and that was the only thing that was fairly prices for what you get.  But if you knew how much those cuts are to get from a supplier, you'd be asking questions about the prices even then.

On two of those occasions we had cheese plates, it was more of a mix and match, you could pick from a few Chevres, Softs and hard cheeses,  they were incredibly small portions but the breads that came with the platter was very tasty, warm and fresh.  It is typically served with a ramkin of olives.

So overall, sounds like I am bashing this restaurant, I am not but I am dieing to find a reason to go back because there is something good about it, the atmosphere, the lighting, the seasonal menu.  But little things keep me from enjoying Zinc.  Such as the time we sat at the secluded back part of the restaurant, the small courtyard.  Very charming, though some of the waiters, and cooks smoked right outside of the courtyard's gates.  The smell of cheap cigarettes and mumbled chatter caused us to ask for another table, when we did, we were all the sudden looked as ""picky customers"".  

One more tip Zinc, you may want to get the mall janitor to move his trash can from the view of your utmost beatiful courtyard, such promise, undelivered due to tacky flaws that could have been prevented by an attentive manager or even a caring waite staff.

I was completely overwhelmed by the options presented to me: what type of chewies (for the record, that term just doesn't seem right), base drink, optional flavorings, etc.  It was a lot for this gal to handle.  Luckily, Alica B. was at my side leading me down the boba path.  

She helped me pick out a concoction of Thai iced tea and regular boba.  Gotta start with the original boba, right?  She ended up with a coffee drink with coffee jellies.  I feel like I'm now ""in the know"" because she asked for the coffee jellies and even though they weren't on the menu, they indeed had them.  That's a little insider's tip from me to you.  Wink wink.  She was so excited I thought she was going to consider this woman the Patron Saint of Boba and commence worship on the spot.

I was surprised to find how incredibly filling boba is.  I wasn't hungry for hours!  Overall, it was good.  I don't see myself craving boba, but if someone wants to go, then I'm in.

Haus just doesn't quite measure up. The cup of soup before the entree tasted like it came out of a can and the bread looked like the sheets of Hawaiian bread you buy at wally world. Probably the biggest turn off was when they brought out the brown mustard still in a plastic squeeze container. 
My meal was the Nuernberger/Kassler combo for one, and I had enough left over for breakfast the next day. Their sausages seem to be of lesser quality than I would get at Sunflower and the red cabbage had some pork gristle in it. Not that I mind a little pork fat in my cabbage, but not chunks, and definitely not gristle. My friend ordered the Huehner (Chicken) Schnitzel, which had a very good flavor, it was the best part of either of our meals.

I usually order the #6 - Beef Kebab, but I have tried their #3 - Chicken and Gyros and #7 - Lamb Kebab.  The meat, be it beef, chicken, lamb, or gyro, is always moist and tender.  Like their meat, the grilled vegetables have a perfect blend of crispy and lightly seared on the outside, but juicy and steamed on the inside.  The basmati rice is always thoroughly cooked and flavorful.  The same goes for the Homous, Baba Ganoosh, and Yogurt Cucumber Dip.  I highly recommend their house Combination Platter.

The service was very friendly, and the menu had many different items in case you don't like sushi.  We tried 2 different Bento Boxes of ribeye teriyaki (the online menu lists it as new york strip) and chicken teriyaki.  Bento boxes come with so much food!  You start with a pretty good Miso soup, and then the box comes with salad with a yummy soy vinagrette, two pork potstickers, rice, and fruit - in this case, orange and apple slices.  The steak was tastefully seasoned and melted in my mouth.  The chicken was tasty as well, but I liked the beef better.
Then we opted for a few pieces of sushi, since this is a sushi bar.  We had the Nigiri salmon and cooked shrimp, a california roll, and a house specialty called the Tukee Roll.

From what I have seen, somewhat frequent turnover with the Dr.'s I've had.
Right now I have Dr. Susman, she's concise, to the point, compassionate, easy to understand.

Oral surgeon Dr. Lillien does his job well, I got my wisdom teeth out without complications or infections later.
Healed up pretty well.

Scheduled out pretty far so difficult to get an appointment in if you have specific avail abilities.

Certain staff could use more training on procedure and techniques to expedite the process and minimize x-ray radiation time.

Julie is doing a breast cancer walk, so donate (personal check) and get teeth whitening kit for 99 dollars.

About staff:

Kendall is very friendly and professional.
Noreen seems like she could use more training (quite a few x-ray retakes with bite tabs), but she was friendly overall.
The process took a bit longer than I anticipated.

Suggestions:
Train the staff thoroughly, with technique and procedure so it can speed up customer service. especially with bite tab as well as the other kind (the red circular one). Customers like to minimize their radiation exposure time : )

Clean office and helpful reception staff. Dr. Susman was to the point and very clear about wahts going on and what to do next.


downfall:

I was craving sushi and had a hot date with my sister-in-law last night to do dinner and a movie... It just so happened that Eat Pray Love was playing at the Tempe Marketplace Harkins Theater, so we decided to meet at Kabuki before the movie.  

I walked in first and asked how long the wait was for two... I as told 10 or 15 minutes.  Not so bad... so I decided to wait.  I walked outside and met up with my Alexa and we came back in about ten minutes later... As we did so, two other women came in and I saw that they were seated right away.  I looked at Alexa, looked up at the hostess stand, was thinking (WTF), and then went and asked nicely where we were on the list.  

""There are two tables before you,"" I was told.  ""It will likely be another ten minutes or so."" 

At that, I responded, ""is there another option, perhaps sushi bar, that I don't know about?""

And alas, there sure was... (they neglected to give me that option when I originally checked-in).  We were seated at the sushi bar at that moment and went on to have a very underwhelming meal.  Here's why:

-While the large portion cucumber salads we ordered were extremely tasty, the cucumbers were cut lengthwise in such a way that it was difficult to eat.  I prefer cucumbers diced in smaller pieces so they are easier to eat!

-Service - our waiter wasn't the friendliest... I felt kind of rushed by him when we were there.  Additionally, since we were seated in the middle of the sushi bar, all of the wait staff would reach over us to pick up the sushi for their tables, which was very distracting while we were eating!  Perhaps they could've moved the sushi ready for pick-up to the side of the sushi bar to avoid distracting guests in the future?

-The sushi itself was good; not amazing.  We had a Sunset roll, a Lotus roll, a Large roll, and an order of Ikura.  I didn't realize the Lotus roll was going to have a ton of mayo along with the baked Lobster that came on top of it... it was a bit on the creamy side for my liking.

-To top things off, when the bill came, they overcharged us... a simple mistake, but given our experience, it was just one more negative thing... and then when I pointed it out, I barely got an apology at all.

Alfonso was our waiter, and he was awesome and didn't hesitate to make suggestions that we were happy to add to our dinner. First, the margaritas. ....this place knows how to pour, and they are fresh  - the only way we will drink them.

Entree: we chose the Chorizo Porchetta and the Scallops. Both were excellent and may I say that the timing of each course was unbelievably prompt. We never waited and yet didn't feel rushed.
Dessert: I confess that I read the dessert menu first before making dinner decisions, and while other reviews loved the selections ...I wasn't blown away. The churros were small and dough-y, and the milkshake was just to heavy/sweet after a meal.....better to fill the churros with a cheese and serve them warm on dulce de leche ice cream. Fried bananas didn't excite me either. Bananas are bananas..... The pumpkin bread pudding seemed heavy and Autumn-like for a 110 degree day in Arizona and did not compliment the Latin flavors of the dinner.

I went to Mint Thai with my in-laws, who love the place, so I had high expectations. It's a nice restaurant, with ample seating, and a good atmosphere. The menu can be a little intimidating.

I picked something in the 60s with chicken and red curry. It was really delicious, with unique flavors and a good spiciness. My only difficulty was that my food was basically swimming in the sauce. I ended up packing some up to take home, and ended up with a plate still full of sauce.

Not balls of falafel meat where the outside is slightly crunchy and the inside is meaty and moist.  The pita bread is not.  It's just some flat bread cut into little triangles.

I ordered two topping-heavy small pizzas from Naked Pizza.  I had a Groupon for $20 that only cost me $10.  So, keep in mind I am rating this on my entire experience that cost me merely $10 out of pocket.

The good?  The garlic topping is delicious.  The employees were friendly.  They were generous with their toppings.    

The bad? Daiya cheese is disgusting on this pizza and tasted like raw dough.  If you're off dairy, get the pizza sans cheese.  It will probably be a lot better!

The just okay?  The crust was okay-tasting, if not a little plain and dry.  The sauce was pretty good for one of us and just okay for the other.  

This is one of the two times in my life that I have ordered pizza and not kept the leftovers.  Of two adults and three kids eating the two small pizzas, we were left with one and a half 10"" pizzas, which we promptly tossed in the bin.  My daughter disliked this pizza so much, she picked off a few of her toppings and then told me she was full (when she said earlier how famished she was).

I'm Indian and I can assure you this place is good. I have never been to Udupai Cafe but based on its failing health inspections, I would be scared to eat there.

They also have excellent Indian Chinese dishes.   The food is consistently good and I have eaten there on several occassions.  This is a lunch/light dinner place.  Don't think of this place like a restaurant.  There are several types of Dosa and that's what this place specializes in.  The restaurant is also modern and not is some ghetto strip mall so don't worry about failing health codes here...at least not for a while.

Negatives
Their non-South Indian dishes are not so good. For non-Indians, they should be informed that this is a Dosa house so order dosa and other south Indian dishes.  Don't order your typical Indian restaurant favorites like palak paneer (it wasn't good here).   The owner also says every dish is excellent which isn't true; he is kind of a businessman so he doesn't really care about telling you which dishes stand out.

The restaurants ands bar are all super expensive and not worth the price - but if you are sans-car you are trapped.  The saving grace here is the little 'coffee shop' by the entrance.  There they have very tasty sandwiches and beverages for a decent price - grab some eats there and go sit outside or on your patio.

With a party of six, I was excited to get to see a range of dishes and try out most of the menu via my dining companions choices.  The restaurant, found in Tempe near ASU, is not hard to find and houses both indoor and outdoor seating.  The outdoor seating is where we ended up last night and between the fire pit in the middle of the grounds and the abundance of trees/greenery, the setting works quite well.  

Our party was seated immediately and without problem, the night was off to a solid start.  Our waitress, Jamie, was both friendly and courteous.  Jamie had a great understanding of the menu, the specials and especially the wine.  Her recommendations for multiple members of the party worked out perfectly.  Each person in our party ordered an appetizer and off we went.

I had the pork belly, on Jamie's suggestion. Other choices within our party included the salmon cake, sweetbreads two ways, and the scallops.  I thought the pork belly was great. It had a pea puree as a base sauce and some baby carrots that just killed.  The scallops were tasty and cooked perfectly.  The sweetbreads two ways were a bit of a letdown.  As a lover of sweetbreads, I have had the pleasure of tasting some of the best variations of there preparation. These were just not that great.  They weren't cooked properly and the seasoning was lacking.  This would be the only lacking dish of the evening.

For the entree, I had the pork osso bucco.  This was a real treat, cooked evenly, tender and tasty.  Other entree selections around the table included the ahi tuna, the salmon, and the duck.  The tuna was the standard seared variety on a bed of mashed potatoes.  Both diners who chose this selection were quite satisfied.  My companion had the duck and while she certainly enjoyed the dish, she found the duck slightly fatty.  All around, the entrees were solid and plates were cleaned.  

With little room left for dessert, we ordered three selections for the table to share.  All were good and once again our plates were cleaned off.  The dessert best was agreed upon to be the homemade smore the restaurant produces.  

All in all, this is a solid restaurant with a good atmosphere and good service.  I would eat here again and recommend you to do the same.",0,1,0,12.5,"Positive","4"

It is much more of a consignment store. Most of the things are new (or lightly worn) and are cheaper than retail prices but more expensive than Goodwill. The selection really isn't bad. I have found a few things here I am really happy with. 

Example: A sweet pair of orange high heels from Steve Madden I think. (I don't really give a crap about brand names, I buy things because I like em, no matter the name). They were thirty bones (not too cheap) but probably a lot less than they would have been at the mall (I am guessing, 60?).

Its still a fun store despite the vintage confusion. Everyone who works there I think gets all the good clothes first because they are always so freakin' adorable! Super friendly (not the fake kind either, can you believe someone is f*cking the handshake in this metropolis?).

However, I would say that it's not merely the random selection of home decorating supplies and upholstery tools/materials that makes Tempe Sales great. It's the family-run vibe that you get from them. On one trip, to pick up several cases of flooring material, I had to go with the owner Alan to his warehouse down the street. In light of buying as much as I did and helping pull it from the warehouse, he threw in plenty of sublayment material for free (otherwise on closeout). The staff (many of whom are part of the family) have also helped me reupholster furniture and work on plenty of other odd jobs. There is no shame in being an amateur at Tempe Sales, even though it is primarily geared toward professionals.

If you're in the market for fabric, please do yourself a favor and check it out. I bet that you will return soon thereafter just to browse around some more. The only downsides that come to mind also make the experience more interesting -- stock levels are not always reliable and parts of the store have historically been disorganized (much better now than in the past), but my experience may be skewed since I gravitate toward closeout deals.",2,1,0,3,"Positive","4"

Overall, pretty darn good.  

The food is on par with the tempe location.  The pastas were delicious - I really liked the Boa Bowtie pasta.   

Wines were solid and complimented the meal nicely.

As with the Tempe location, the best part for us is always the Shrimp Adriatica appetizer.  We could just eat a big bowl of that with bread.  The sauce is amazing, the shrimp is well cooked.  The only downside was that it was just regular french bread (or similar) - the tempe location has the fancier, tastier varieties of fresh baked bread.  But the quality of shrimp and sauce was the same.  

Service was slow at first (we went late on a Sat night as they were slowing down), but was friendly, made great recommendations and were very helpful overall.  By the end of the meal, I had forgotten about the slow start.  Think we just walked in at an awkward time, which as I said, they really made up for by the end of the meal.  

Also, the warm butter cake was decadent.  Maybe not as good as Mastro's butter cake, but it's on the way there.  Really tasty, very fresh.  I could have used some fresh whipped cream or a little vanilla ice cream to go with it, but that's a personal thing.  

On a side note - the Zinfandel they are currently offering (think it was like $6-7/glass) is fantastic.  I was impressed at the quality compared to the price.

As you walk in, the bartender is standing behind in an elaborate wooden bar structure. This made me think publican instead of bartender (as in ""Mate, I'll take a pint and d'ya have any rooms available?""), which is probably the idea. As there was nice selection of draught beers, we walked around to the bar to the right and ordered a couple of pints. I ordered a Boddingtons, my friend ordered a Stateside micro brew. (Would have been nice if they had Old Peculiar on tap, but you can't have everything.) 

Due to the combination of things cooking in the kitchen, it smelled a bit like my grandma's house. This prompted us to make a beeline for the patio decorated with super-heavy wood furniture. I assume this is to discourage thieves from selling their tables and chairs on the black market. Smart. The piped-in music selection that night was a bit off-putting, in fact, one of the other patrons commented on it as well. It appeared to be a satellite radio station that specialized in 80s hits like Wham! and Depeche Mode. I guess George Michael and David Gahan ARE British. Indeed! Wikipedia just informed me that ""Dave Gahan (born May 9, 1962 in Epping, Essex, England) is the baritone lead singer for the English electronic band Depeche Mode, and is also an accomplished solo artist."" Now I feel better. 

There are many cozy nooks in this place, so that would be a good thing if you wanted to have some one-on-one time. They were also playing football (soccer) on the flat screens, so should make some team scarf-wearing Brit ex-pats in the Valley very happy.

My previous research told me that there were many 5 stars and 3 stars reviews regarding the ambiance, service and food. It seemed that the place had be 5-stars for a while but trending analysis showed a decline in the late 2011- early 2012. Alright enough nerd talk-  it was a Saturday morning, I was starving and I needed a place to have brunch with my lady friend in town.

When it comes to brunch at Yoli's, you really need to leave all your expectations at the door. The neighborhood its in is a little sub-par, the parking situation isn't grand and the interior and patio decor resembles a home that stopped paying for landscaping services a long time ago. The tables outside are all basic basic plastic, they are not squeaky clean (or perfectly leveled) and the seating is pretty limited. If you are coming to Yoli's, you are coming here for the food and nothing else, this ain't no brunch at the Four Seasons.

Their menus are strictly breakfast/brunch related but at a 2-sided page list, their breakfast choices do have a large variety of flavors and prices. The food is on the stealthier side with skillet dishes, omelets and diner-style potato sides. My friend and I ordered their most popular dish, the El Monte- Hawaiian french toast sandwich filled with egg whites, turkey, bacon and cheese with a 'spicy orange marmalade'. At about $7, the sandwich was pretty large and filled me up easily after just half of it. The french toast itself was soft and spongy and the bacon had some crisp, but the turkey was very thinly-sliced deli meat so it didn't have a lot of flavor and the spicy marmalade was tasty but not spicy at all.

The service was a tad slow but the lady was very very courteous and nice to us, she just didn't stop by very often so we had to wait around for our drinks and our check for quite a while. Overall I wasn't blown away with Yoli's but I would recommend as a place with decent portions and good prices. As of now, a 3.75 stars on my book.

I am a big supporter of local restaurants and I love seeing a family-owned business thrive. With a little bit more decor, faster service and a cleaner environment this place can return to be the GEM that people used to talk about.

We had a reservation for 8PM for 4 of us, and at 730PM Andrea asked us to add 2 guests and when Dottsy called Metro they said of course, but please be advised you may have a little wait for the larger table. Which leads me to the only bad point of the evening:

We had to wait ONE AND A HALF HOURS for our larger table. We had all expected and accepted a 30 minute wait. After about 40 we went to the bar to get some wine and oysters (otter creeks = yummmm).  After an hour had passed and no one had come to address the situation with our group, I approached the hostess and she was very apologetic and offered to comp our bar tab, which was incredibly nice. 

When we were finally seated our server was friendly and attentive and had gorgeous blue eyes. Hello!  We were all starving and got right to the point with our orders: I started with the cucumber soup and no amount of yums or mmmmms can fully describe the delight that was set before me. A cold soup, this is made with cucumbers, buttermilk, dill and olive oil, with chunks of lump crabmeat and a dollop of caviar thrown on top, because why the hell not?!  Also, the soup came in a really large bowl and I was full by the time I finished it. I did soldier on to my main course which was the Moules Frites which is what I had the first time I came here and is a truly inspired dish with juicy fresh mussels, and a broth with thyme, garlic and perhaps a little white wine. Then to add insult to injury they serve the huge casoulet with a hearty portion of herbed french fries that were the perfect crispness and didn't leave oil on my hands. 

Sadly I had to leave some of those friends behind, but only because it was time for dessert! I chose pot de creme which is normally topped with brioche. I requested a brioche-free pot and it was no problem. I was served a tiny ramekin of creamy custard topped with a sort of peanut butter syrup/creme and three slices of caramelized banana. It was really yummy though within 10 minutes my heart was racing from all the sugar. 

I will point out that this dinner took 2 full hours (we left at 11:30PM) making this the longest I ever spent in a restaurant (3.5 hours are you kidding me?) which is why I ultimately docked one star. Based on food alone Metro Brasserie deserves 10 stars.",2,4,1,2,"Positive","4"

The restaurant was lovely dim-lit, adequate atmosphere for an expensive steak place. We were seated immediately and tended to by the waiting staff. The small roll of bread and two kinds of butter were good but insufficient for four hungry souls and we polished it up right away. No one offered to bring more. Our waiter told us about the daily specials, after which we ordered food and wine. After a short wait, four large dinner plates arrived. I was the lucky one, my steak (a large  rib eye steak, ordered medium-rare which tasted very good despite two large blobs of fat) was sitting pretty in the middle of the large dinner plate. Nothing else on my plate, just the steak. I looked around at my wife's plate and couldn't believe, her fillet mignon was laying there, in the middle of the large dinner plate without anything garnishing it, be that a glaze, a leaf, a slice of whatever! At the prices asked by this restaurant, it felt like an insult to each of us to have such a poor presentation of a steak!! We asked our waiter for a side dish, mashed potatoes with Parmesan, and when they arrived, we couldn't believe it! There were no more than two scraggly potatoes turned into mashed potatoes, or about a tablespoon of mashed potatoes per person. Mind you, they tasted good, but at over $9.00 per side dish?

I had looked at their website before ordering & the combo (pepperoni, sausage, onions, mushrooms & green peppers-but we skipped the onions) sounded delish so we got that with the NY mild wings.

Yes. Yes they do.

Is the force of making killer fast Mexican food strong with these Jedis? 

Oh hell yeah!

Try the shredded beef tacos in the hard shells. When they ask you if you want hot sauce, say 'si' and drizzle it mightily onto the tacos. Piled cheese, beef, lettuce, tomatoes all stuffed into an authentic-style taco shell - it doesn't get any better than this. Just make sure you put a helmet on because it's crazy good.

If you like spicy, no-nonsense burritos, go with the Carne Asada Burrito (Red Chile).

If you like the whole meal, go with the Carne Asada or Pollo Asado burrito combo plates. The plate comes with flour tortillas, beans and rice, guacamole and salsa fresca. You make your own burritos. This is just good eatin'. Take it home, crack open a good Hefeweizen, and you are golden.

And lastly, from the sage words of my wife: ""The shrimp tacos and burritos are certified gourmet meals!"" Do I stutter? Nope.

While Senor Taco is technically 'fast food' it does take some time to prepare. If you do drive-thru don't get all road ragey if it takes longer than it does at Taco Bell. There is a price to pay to make good food and that price is TIME. This is not a worldwide chain that spends more on advertising and earning your business by putting cute little dogs on plastic mugs. Senor Taco is not that type of place. A little wait is very much worth it.

I realize that appearance of the location irks some reviewers. Yes, it is in a strip mall. Yes it is 100-150 feet away from a gas station slash AM/PM mini market. I get that. But this is not Sanctuary. This is not Kai. This is not Deseo. When one reviewer (and I use the word 'reviewer' loosely here) hilariously claims to have walked in, used his Superman vision to supposedly spot a family of offending microbes and (without trying the food) proceeded to sprint out because he was frightened of all the imagined cooties ... well... I just have to laugh. That's not a review, it's a drive-by, and reviewers like this are probably happier with Hometown Buffet or Luby's Cafeteria. And that's too bad because this is excellent fast food.

I believe the buffet itself is about $10 and for that you get a wide range of vegetarian items and as with other items on the buffet most of those get changed out over time so you get a rotation of various dishes as you come back. They also have hummus and baba ghanoush (like hummus but made with eggplant instead of chickpeas). There is generally at least one dish with red meat (today it was a tomato based stew with eggplant and either beef or lamb) and usually two dishes with chicken.

I generally get iced tea to go with the meal and one thing to note, they do not serve alcohol so if you want to go someplace where you can also have a drink or two, this would not be a good place to go but if you just want a place with really good Middle Eastern food (the owners told me it is really Lebanese cooking but I'm going to just generalize and say for most of us, when you try it, you will think Middle Eastern). Of course, you can walk a block or two to 4 peaks brewery, in the same area, and have a drink or two before or after you your meal.

Had my windshield replaced by these schmucks. The morons tore up the interior of my car, and damaged a speaker cover. 

I had to call them about replacing the cover thrice, they finally did, and then I found out that there was a HUGE air leak in the corner. They never fixed the interior trim.

They sent out the same first idiots to plug the leak, and they ended up breaking a ton of clips for a covering on my car, ruining the windshield wiper covers, and DOUSING my tweeter in water.

Had some drinks in the parking lot before the show- a few tailgaters were around us, pretty nice crowd overall with no hassles.
There is no way that they should have any shows there between June to August! Thank God the weather broke and it cooled down.. you get that many people together dancing around and it generates some heat!

I always assumed the best tapas disappeared when Aaron May sauteed Sol Y Sombra's last batch of butter-marinated brussels sprouts! Well, I was proven wrong when I hit up the ultra-cool Sens Asian Tapas & Sake on a Thursday night. 

Guests are greeted by electric blue lights, neon pink lotus blossom light fixtures and fresh beats courtesy of a hipster DJ, which transport the hungry to an intoxicating, fluorescent experiens filled with sauces, sakes, and spicy flavors they probably don't even know about yet. 

I tried three top-notch items:

Wasabi Tofu- Hot, in every Sens of the word. Wasabi and 300-degree tempura crusties have the ability to burn you to your soul if you aren't careful. Don't skip it, just poke it with a chopstick or blow on it first. 

White Peach Juice and Vodka- Just like Japanese candy exchange students brought home in high school, it's one of those miraculous flavors most Americans will never have the opportunity to try. Light and sweet, but not overly so, it's a perfect blend you can sip all.night.long. (I did!)

The best, by far, is the Hot & Sour Soup. It's nothing like the kind you get for .99 at Chinese restaurants as an appetizer. A Bilbo Baggins-ey cauldron arrives with a wooden ladle- among the various veggies and disc-shaped noodles is your choice of meat- I chose clams. I've always heard you can truly tell how talented a chef is by how tasty his soup is, and would have to agree. There's nothing to hide behind, and you're confronted by pure flavor. It was complex, different and mouthwatering.

The whole Sens-ation was so genius, I even got past the embarrassment of Chef Johnny Chu snorting in my face for taking pics of my meal on my iPhone.",1,0,0,7,"Positive","4"

Now the word around town is that The Grind is Sofa_King Great.  I will say about The Grind that when you're up for a Burger, this place hits the spot.  I've been here once before August 2010 (don't remember what burger I had but recall it was good) and the other night I had the Peppercorn Burger and it was as good as it gets.  I was starving and really hadn't eaten all day and that helped add to how much this hit the spot, but make no mistake, it was really good and I do enjoy this place for the atmosphere, service, and quality of food.  My friends wife got one of those healthy wraps and she liked it a lot.  The sweet potato fries (we ordered the half sweet potato and half regular fries) and they were good.

As for some other areas to review: The atmosphere is nice.  It's casual and not too dark and not too light inside.  (That's how I like it).  There's multiple flat panel TV's above the bar, so plenty of games on at any given time (That's also how I like it).  The service is fine (although based on some other reviews people have been so so satisfied about the service.  That's often going to be the case with most casual establishments - so sometimes it's good, and sometimes not to our satisfaction).  Such is Life!  Anyway, back on track here, the Wait staff and Bar staff have been worth the 20% tip both times.  No complaints by me about this place, however I do see some 2 and 3 star ratings on here.  

Where I will dock 1 star and sort of agree with Kristi D.  She mentioned the large photo of Sheriff Joe Arpaio on the wall (while I sense that Kristi doesn't care for Sheriff Joe, I'm neutral about him), but I agree about all the oversized photos of notable names in town who have dined in The Grind.  I'd much rather see real artwork or real photographs on the wall - and not photos of Sheriff Joe, Mark Grace (for those who don't know, he's a former baseball player), and the Mayor of Paradise Valley, all holding their burgers.  Who the hell cares about any of them and their burgers.  I think I'd be more ok with having these photos above me, but they are HUGE enlargements and a bit overkill.  And they are for sale and the proceeds go to some cause.  Look, I'm all for causes and shit, but I wouldn't spend my money on a 36 inch enlargement of these local ""notables"" holding a burger.  The whole concept is pretty stupid.  But hey, I'm generally uptight and been doing photography 20+ years and probly am just hating on the fact that my photos are hanging on the wall.
 
Side Note:  For those who might have previously had ""Liked"" The Grind on Facebook but no longer have their page as a Like, it's because they apparently had their group page hacked, so they had to start over.  I found this out when I Liked it the other day noticed there were only about 165 Like's, and certainly I knew this place was way more popular than that.  When I commented that, they commented back about it being hacked and starting the page over.

1.  Great decor and ambience; would be better minus the flat screens
2.  Friendly service; but needs more training with food and knowledge of

4.  Food; if you specialize in spring rolls, please make sure they are rolled up proficiently.  It needs to be tight, not loose:) Flavors are good, but there could be a variation of sauce for the spring rolls.  4 rotating flavors for over 20 rolls is not a good ratio.
5.  Pricing is not bad for some items, but I do agree with other reviews that for most items, the pricing is a little high for the neighborhood biz and the quality of food offered.

Overall, nice place to hang with friends for a drink and nibble before the actual dinner somewhere else.
I will give it a few more months for an update.  This place has potential, but not well executed. When opening a restaurant, you should be ready and able to.

DO-Order a sweet potato pie to go. That happens to rock the house!
Have the pulled pork sandwich. Solid sandwich.

DONT--Do not and I mean DO NOT order the chicken BBQ sandwich. I ordered this a couple months ago and I could have used the shredded chicken as toothpicks. They were hard and came served in a weird cone-like shape on the bun. Also, skip the sweet potato fries. They are dry and taste like dirt. Yep, I said it. Sorry Stacy. Back to the drawing board on those.

The sauce is everything at a BBQ joint and his is just OK. Actually, I have had better in a store-bought bottle from AJs.

If you are in the area, go for it. If you live out in Glendale, it's probably not worth the drive. I am not sure what Bon Appetite was thinking when they gave this one of the top 10 new BBQ joints of 2009.

We ordered the calamari and the stuffed mushrooms (1/2 orders) and STILL, the servings were huge.  Six big stuffed mushrooms sitting on what seemed to me to be the biggest plate I have ever seen serving an appetizer.  They were great and tasty, but cooled down too quickly and who can do anything about that?  The calamari was decent, could have been spiced up a bit or served with something more than marinara sauce, but for those who don't like a lot of fan fare with their food, this would be perfect; classic calamari with classic sauce.  We loved the Stella Artois draft beer and martinis came out big and filled to the brim, just how I like them.  For our entrees we ordered the Baked Ziti and Sausage and the Rigatoni ""D"".  Both of them were absolutely fantastic...yumm.  And both were HUGE.  The baked ziti stayed warm right up until we packed the rest to take home because they actually bake it right in the ceramic type dish that they serve it in, very smart.  For those with little ones, the kids menu is awesome and probably the healthiest meal a kid is going to get anywhere.  Nothing at this place is pre packaged or pre made and that goes for the kids meals as well.  Their chicken fingers are home made (the pickiest of adults would eat these things!), no french fries; home made mashed potatoes and broccoli florets.  This is the KIDS menu!  Our waiter needed to be coaxed out of his shell, but he was still warm in that great way that the good ones know how to do without intruding.  Great leather booths, linen napkins, white table cloths with a white and red checkered one thrown on top for added warmth, elegant, but not stuffy.  Guys could go in with t-shirts and dress shorts and fit right in and for the ladies who like to dress up, you can as well with out feeling overly so.

I was in Tempe. I was having coffee. I was sedate. I wanted to see if anyone wanted join me and discuss Kafka or something boring. And so I called up the town's most famous resident to see what was goin' down.

""Um, YOU need to see sketchy Tempe. It is time. And I will be the one who will show it to you. Meet me at Time Out Lounge. No, wait. Meet me at Monkey Pants. Yes, Monkey Pants!""

And so I did. 

Monkey Pants! Sorry folks, but this name is nonsensically awesome. I walked in and sat myself at the round bar, joining a smattering of other patrons sitting there by themselves, each staring into nowhere in particular. Well drinks for $2.50, served in a standard kitchen glass. Nice! I proceeded to watch the football game and was soon joined by my Tempe tour guide.

We were approached by the bartender to do discounted Patron shots....but only if we wore sombreros. There was barely anyone here on a Sunday night, and I'm of the kind who doesn't care anyway, and the thought of me and Bonnie G sitting at a desolate stripmall bar with sombreros on is kind of ridiculous and great at the same time, but shots were not on my agenda for the night. Alas.

I then got a royal tour of the place, including the great leg lamp (actually it's two legs, not just one!), shuffleboard, pool tables, couches with a cozy fire being played on endless loop on a big screen TV, ample board games and another section with tables and chairs, which is where we sat, under the painting of the teddy bear in Richard Simmons gear. 

Other patrons were seated all over the large space, so everyone had their own private area in a way. I actually really dug this. I'm not one who needs a place to be crowded to enjoy myself or feel like ""it's happening."" Sitting around a fake fire with pints and board games with a few friends is more my speed these days anyway. So I may sound decrepit, but I'm really not that old. I swear.

Sure, Monkey Pants has frat-party gimmicks throughout the day, but this place has no pretense whatsoever. How can you even take it seriously? Even it doesn't take itself seriously. 

I mean, it's just sitting there. In a strip mall. In Tempe. With a painting of a teddy bear wearing Richard Simmons workout gear on the wall and a stack of sombreros sitting next to a popcorn machine. Waiting for you to leave your critical mind behind and enjoy the now.

Even my Bloody Mary had a slice of crisp bacon in it along with a celery spear, olives and onions. Probably one of the best Bloody Mary's I have had in awhile. 

The location is a little off the beaten path which is why, I think, people are lined up to get in the Breakfast Club a couple of blocks away for mediocre food, and here at Bacon- the food and service is better and there was no line on the Sunday I was there. 

I was seated in what they call ""the nook"" located on the side where I had full view of the restaurant. The menu was well organized and entrees come with toast and breakfast potatoes and your choice of a side of bacon or ham. You can also substitute fresh tomatoes if that is your wish. 

The food came up quickly and was delicious! My ham and cheese omelet was perfectly done (all melted cheese and ham inside and firm eggs on the outside) and the side of bacon was crisp and tasty. Given the size, this easily was a 4 egg omelet. Breakfast with drinks ran about $20 which was cheap for all the food I got. 

But I would be remiss if I didn't talk about what really blew me away about this place. It's the fantastic service! Everyone seems to be part of a larger team. I was greeted by one person, seated by another and had at least three servers taking care of me. And countless people stopped by to ask how things were, if I needed more water for my tea, or if I wanted more preserves for my toast. It was unbelievable! While they have been open for 9 months- they had the staff of a place that has been open much longer. 

The ambiance is contemporary but is warmed up by the blue booths, checkered table cloths, and some mismatched dining tables in the center that can be expanded for larger groups. There are also antique food cases lining the walls filled with tins of chocolate, and other food ""cues"". I also liked that they have those ""roll up"" doors on the one side that bring the outdoors in and seats outside on those perfect days.

We enjoyed the Abbaye de Bellocq and Taleggio Caravaggio cheeses with the order of the French plate that included pate, cornichons, figs, Dijon mustard, dried cranberries, and baguette.  None at the table were very knowledgeable about cheeses, but we told our server Zach our likes and dislikes and he steered us in the right direction.  This was a very nice start to the meal and ample for four people.  We paired it with an '08 Cakebread Sauvignon Blanc.  

There was a dinner entree of risotto cakes w/ peas, asparagus, and mushrooms that we all wanted to try so we put it in as an order for an appetizer.  The portion was fairly small so it was perfect for an appetizer, but I would have been a little disappointed had someone ordered it for their main course.

For our entrees two of us ordered the duck and the other two ordered the scallops.  The duck was prepared perfectly with crisp skin and moist breast.  This was served atop a red-wine risotto with blackberry gastrique. The menu stated there would be seasonal vegetables, but I caught very few on my plate.  The scallops were also cooked perfectly and were served with spinach/tomato/olive pasta.  We ordered a bottle of Delas ""Saint-Esprit"" Cotes du Rhone.  I felt bad about ordering one of the cheapest bottles on the menu (only $20!), but the Cotes du Rhone caught my eye and I wanted to try it.  It ended up being a very nice wine, whatta steal.

Due to dietary restrictions of one guest, we had to request a change on one of the entrees and the server was very respectful of it and discussed it with the chef who obliged with no issues.  Kudos for going out of their way to take care of us.

For dessert we had a chocolate cookie filled with molten chocolate served with ice cream, along with crème brulee.  Both were not out of this world, but a nice finish nonetheless to a fabulous meal.

All in all this was a great place that was very reasonably priced where you could go all out and not feel too bad when the bill came. :) I enjoyed the wine list and it was apparent that they did not markup their wines as much as other restaurants.  The only reason this place does not get 5 stars is portion size, lack of vegetables with the entree (I much enjoy a meal of protein, vegetable, starch with somewhat equal ratios), and there was not one ""wow"" factor in which I will be telling my friends ""You MUST order this dish"" or a dish I have to come back for.   I wouldn't have minded the small portion size at all had it perhaps been on a bigger plate with more use of color.  

I would definitely enjoy coming back and would love to try their happy hour.  I also love how they are open on Monday evenings since a lot of nice places aren't.

I was delightfully surprised at how much the store offers in such a small space. Grant it you are not going to get many choices on some items, but you may be surprised at some of the items you do find. There were plenty of choices for organic foods and ""green"" products, also. 

The good:
convenience - for those of you that has one in your neighborhood. Easy to get in and out of with front door parking.

PRICE - The prices are as low as Walmart's but without the hassle of having to deal with the super-store size. (they accept coupons too - even better) 

Ready meals - Great concept. Many places do this, but I found that it was easy (and fun) to create a full meal. Main courses, salads, sides, sandwiches and desserts all labeled and located in one place. If you don't have time to cook give it a shot. It is not as cheap as cooking it yourself but lasagna for two people for six bucks isn't bad. 

The bad:
Stay away from the Rotisserie Chicken. A little dry and over-cooked. I've had better at Fry's, Costco. Save your tastebuds.

In a world of Mega-stores with mega-parkiing lots it is nice to have a place that is actually cheaper to go to and within walking distance. 

The best way to describe Marketside is if you were to cram the Walmart food section and the Wholefoods quality and organic cool factor  in a space the size of Walgreens.",2,6,1,5,"Positive","4"

The food was very cheap, and incredibly flavorful. So, if you're on a budget, and want to either impress a date with your culture, or are a foodie, this is a great place to try! I am writing it only as 4 stars only because I haven't tried any other Ethiopian food. However, I pretty much don't want to risk tr.ying another place ;)

The Ethiopian tea they serve is fantastic, along with your meal. The portions are generous, along with generous amount of of injera. We has more than enough food around us, and left stuffed.

The dish that especially impressed me, was the curry chicken. So much so, that I continually kept enjoying the injera in the sauce. 

All the vegetarian food was delicious! I, unfortunately, don't remember the names of everything, but the greens were some of the best I've ever had, along with a lentil dish. 

Also, I rated this good for kids, however, that's only because I have a toddler that eats anything! If you don't have problems feeding your kid unique food, I suggest an attempt!

In short, if you're a big food fan, or want to be a little more adventurous on your food options, especially for a great, fair price, try Blue Nile!!",0,1,0,6.5,"Positive","4"

"9691","dAejHdhn19GmDtmqBgZ3Bw","4","Good food for a good price.  First time I've eaten at this location but it was as good as I hoped.  I got a half size Crunch Roll for an appetizer, and an order of Chicken Yakisoba.  Both were very good.  The crunch roll was very fresh with good quality ingredients, crunchy shrimp Tempura, crab, avocado, etc.  The yakisoba wasn't quite what I thought it would be in that the noodles and meat were separate, not mixed, but that didn't affect the quality or flavor.  It was closing time and I'd only eaten half, but I packed up the rest and brought it back to my motel so the workers could finish up and go home. 

This was the fourth place I'd attempted to go to for dinner so I was especially happy to find them open.  The first place, Azucar Peruvian, was right across the street from the motel I always stay at and I'd been meaning to try them since last summer.  I drove over there to find they were now out of business with a sign up advertising the place going in next.  I snoozed, I loozed.

 The second place was supposed to be open till 8:30pm according to their Yelp listing, but was closed when I got there a  few minutes after 8.

The third place, Omega Gyros, highly recommended on Yelp, was also out of business.  FML.

"9698","nW0bT4oCSeFdfJggs9cqVQ","5","Love this place! I went with my Grandma and Aunt on a Thursday afternoon. The weather was great but just a tad windy so we sat inside. First I like the layout of this place, very open and airy. There are 2 outside patios one street level and then one upstairs. I actually have been here twice so far. First time was just for a mid afternoon cocktail with one of my stylists. The servers were very friendly and our concoction of vodka, grapefruit and cranberry juice was the perfect blend. 
The second time we ordered 3 small plates to share, ahi tacos, artichoke and spinach dip and the mussels. All three were heavenly and very reasonably priced. The ahi was fresh and chilled, perfect for a warm day. The artichoke dip was different than any I have had before, gooey cheesy goodness that we gobbled up practically licking the bowl. The chips that accompanied the did were fresh and perfectly salted, even when the dip was done we still polished off the chips. The mussels were in a perfect white wine sauce but the stars of this dish were the mussels themselves. Buttery and melt in your mouth good, not chewy at all with no grit, to most common problem I find. The broth was so good I let the bread marinate at the bottom of the bowl, soaking up the juice. My martini was a generous pour and even though they were out of blue cheese stuff olives the bartender took the time to stuff some and deliver it to our table. 
Now on to the staff, all are a good looking lot but they are also skilled. All of our food and drinks were delivered in a timely manner by our lovely server Jennifer. We also met one of the sous chefs, Lennie. A charming fellow with stunning blue eyes, my grandmother remarked on them, a playful Mohawk and tattoos peaking out of his uniform. He swears that the sweet potato fries are some of the best in town and sent over a complimentary bucket. I do believe he is right, cooked to perfection, slightly crisp on the outside, warm and soft on the inside dusted with fresh herbs and I believe Parmesan cheese. After our meal the manager came over to make sure everything was to our liking.

I enjoyed it in a way I haven't enjoyed a hot dog in years!  Wow, that sounds kind of dirty.  This really is a unique take on one of the most common American foods.

I passed through the sea of trucks and people that is Food Truck Fridays on a mission to finally try the much yelped about Short Leash Dogs.  I can't say much too much that hasn't already been said.  While the 20 minute wait wasn't too thrilling, it all paid off in the end.  I just went with a traditional wiener, with tomatoes, onion, relish and spicy mustard.  While I was intrigued to try some of Short Leash Dog's specialties, most of the dogs on today's menu contained an item or two that I don't really like, and I wanted to compare Short Leash Dogs to what I am accustomed to the first time around.  Good sausage, good toppings and the flat bread is fantastic.

  Pete's fish is ok, square, almost like processed but not. Strange but tasty. Chips are decent, taste like typical Ore-Ida frozen fries. The Onion rings were good (super greasy though). My biggest problem is that I am a bit of a traditionalist. If you are gonna call it ""fish and chips"" like they would in the UK, then you have to at least have malt vinegar. The red sauce is good with their fries and rings (and maybe shrimp) but not on fish. It is the only sauce they have. I hear the burgers are good and may go back, if I am already in the area, to try one. I wonder if they have mustard? They may be trying to do too many things at once here. Seafood, Americana, Mexican, (fish, shrimp, burritos, hot dogs, chicken, oysters) Just a thought.
  The seating is outside, if its summer you must get it to go. Between the heat, pigeons and huge flies (serious kitchen hawks) you will not have a good time.

Not even when a rep came by to alert me to a bar menu sitting on the table and asked me if I had wanted anything from the bar- she had to have noticed the mess?!
I ordered a $9.50 spider roll (soft-shelled crab), a $10 veggie tempura app, and a $19 baked lobster roll, all priced at 50% for one week during their 1-year anniversary.  They're all good, and factoring in the ostentatious surroundings, I'd pay $9.50 for the soft-shelled crab roll, but I'd put my foot down on the other two.  50% maybe, but $19 for a five-piece lobster roll?

I wound up eating here by chance when I was bringing back a group of teens to the JCC a few doors down--we had a few minutes for lunch before bringing the rest of the kids back to tucson. Most of the kids wound up in the mexican place next door, and seeing as we were pressed for time, I decided that Id get some thai food since I love thai. I asked the lady in there if I could get something very quickly to go, she said no problem. I asked if I should get the pad thai or the yellow curry, she said get the yellow curry. So I did. She asked me how hot (and knowing that I had a cold and wanted something kinda spicy, but also momentarily forgetting that I was in a thai restaurant) I told her ""make it pretty hot"". In retrospect, I might have used a bit more caution with that statement. I also ordered some crab puffs which i know is not authentic, but i was in the mood. The crab puffs turned out to be excellent. Just different enough from your standard chinese food arrangement and yet still delicious with their different style dipping sauce. The yellow curry was AMAZING, albeit a LITTLE bit spicier than I would have liked on a normal day...well, actually, it was a freakin inferno...but it felt good to eat it with my cold and all.

Let me say first, that the place is cute, the staff is friendly, and the salsa is good. There. I'm not being a total jerk. 

The food, however, left much to be desired. I couldn't find much to like about my chicken tacos- they were ok, but the meat didn't have much flavor, there was no cheese, and they were pretty stingy with the guacamole and pico. What really got me was that they didn't come with rice and beans. Instead, I got a lovely pile of cheap bagged romaine coated in some sort of caesar-ish dressing. Sure, there were a few cubes of cheese and a tomato slice (A slice!) on top, but come on. $14 for a couple of naked tacos and a pile of romaine? For that much, they could have at least picked the white core parts of the lettuce out of my salad. Or, I dunno, sprinkled a little cheese on the tacos?

The story was much the same with the fish tacos, only the salad was different. The enchiladas seemed to be a hit, and those are served with rice and beans. the vegan at the table ordered a side of rice and beans for her meal, and they aren't kidding about it being a side. I think my cat's food bowl is bigger. 

They charge $1 per bowl if you want more chips. I know $1 isn't a big deal, but it's just the principle. I already felt ripped off from the entree, so the extra charge for the chips just made it worse.

The other day, I agreed to meet my son and little granddaughter there for coffee and a bagel, and found that it is much more than just a bagel stop.  They actually have a restaurant with quite an extensive menu.  I had breakfast - the choices were very diverse - including skillets, various pancakes, bagels (of course), french toast, omelets, and a number of other items.  The servings were large, and the service very prompt and friendly.  Most importantly, the prices were more than reasonable.

The only thing that I disliked, was that they did not have hash browns.  They do have potatoes as an option with the meals, but you cannot actually classify them as hash browns.  They are good - but not quite a replacement for hash browns and gravy.

I actually like it so much, that I stopped and had breakfast two days later on the way to the golf course.  Again, great breakfast at very reasonable prices.

  I walk up to the entrance, I see people smoking outside in a small fence area. I look over and see these groups are starring at me like i just blatantly readjusted myself in public.  I give them one more glance and realize in two hours we all will all be best friends exchanging pointless stories about our days when in reality I couldn't give a flying f*[% about their new kitten they adopted and named Bunbun. But in 2 hours I will thrive and cherish each of their stories and be amazed I never found such intellectual people sooner.

 Before I get to the door I feel eyes spying on me. I look up to find  one of 17 hostesses peering through the window ready to yank the door open a mere second before I reach for it. (you can't beat them to this..  Ive tried several times, they are good at what they do. Just prepare for this and accept it.) 

as I step inside my eyes automatically affix to the bar top. I scan up and down the row of seats. As I'm scanning down I see two empty seats. I'm not sure if guy code applies to bar seats like the bathroom urinals (guys.. You know what I'm talking about)..  But I usually just start the night off not giving a...  Because I already aknowledge the fact things are only going to degrade from here anyways.

 I start with a tall miller light and look up at the game playing on the TV's. I continue my beer almost empty then order some beer battered buffalo chicken tenders with extra ranch. I look into the reflection of my phone to make sure my face isn't suddenly disfigured because she looks at me as if I just asked for an order of wine and chive biscottes. 

I explain that I am looking to get the beer battered buffalo wings then she calls for backup like I'm speaking a foreign language.  ""Hey Lacey! This guy wants beer battered buffalo chicken wings"" they say some things, fumble a bit then come back with..  So you want ""chicken tenders and ranch?"".  I explain again to the both of them. They both tilt their heads to the side. Either this one beer slammed me, and I'm speaking nonsense at this point, or they just don't understand what buffalo wings are.   ""so..you want a cheeseburger and a side of buffalo sauce sir?"". They do a little further team planning and come up with a solution and I end up with beer battered chicken tenders dry as a bone with no sauce and a side of buffalo sauce. My friend getting the opposite  when we both ordered the same thing except he gets no buffalo sauce and a side of ranch.. I find it to bother me less and less each time because I expect it now.  

Their food really is good, and their service is...Did i mention that their food is really good? 

I look back up at the TV acting real smooth and care free only to realize ive been watching female tennis on the television next to me for the past 30 minutes while everyone eIse is attentively watching the football game. I'm not ashamed to admit that I continued watching it. I think it was the loud grunts that kept my attention. I finish eating, grab another beer and me and the friend approach the ping pong table. 
You need to go to the hosts stand to get the equipment. It's free. Wait no it's not..  It's a dollar. Nope that was last month. Now it's 9 bucks an hour. Better empty those pockets. Just remember every hour you waste playing you could have fed 27 starving ethiopians for  a month. But in your drunken stooper you chose to dish out the $9 like myself and play pool or ping pong. Shame on you.

PS.., beware of the twins...  I thought I was loosing my mind after a few beers seeing one girl cover the whole restaurant in a matter of mere seconds. If you ask  your server for something and she looks at you funny...  it's either because you asked her twin, or you asked for buffalo chicken tenders.

 I can't vouch for the chicken tacos but most street tacos are nowhere near packed with meat. By definition they are usually very tiny with onions,some guacamole, a little cabbage, and some small cuts of meat.  I can say the tilapia tacos are tops(large filet on each) on the list of my girlfriend's quest for good fish tacos. I can say the pork nachos are the best I have had as the pork reminds me of Los Dos Molinos in a small way. The empanadas are excellent as well.

If you go for happy hour you can get two empanadas for 6 bucks. You can also get 2 large fish tacos for 6 bucks. Would you like some awesome tortilla soup? 4 bucks.
If you get the dinner version of the emapanadas with a large portion of some of the best rice and a side of black beans I think it sets you back about 11 bucks. I have also had the chili relleno and it is the best I have tasted as well leaving me to wonder with the single review you have for anything, why the venom?

I learned long ago to ask for what is recommended for before you order and if someone recommends a place try what they are harping about first. When I asked they said the chili relleno, pork, empanadas, and red sangrias. Guess how my dining experience went? Try ordering tacos from Los Dos Molinos and you will leave pissed. Order the green chili pork and you will drive 100 miles for it.

I do hope you give it another chance I have honestly never had anything sub par here in my 7 or so visits and they seriously could charge way more for quality than they do.  I agree that Main Ingredient is great also, that's why I took the time to write about it. 

But to reiterate:

11-13 dollar for most dinner items besides new york strip(on the list to try), is not pricey

happy hour has most items for 4-6$

street tacos are not bursting with meat

ask what is the best thing on the menu when you order some place then you can write it off all you want.

Humble Pie  was more pricey and not worth it, All it does is take up parking from a much better place next door. For a place with the reference to pizza in it's name you would think it would be better, it tasted like peter piper.

I would love to know what a good chicken taco is in your opinion, I cant think of any besides maybe the California tacos at the now closed Chuy's, but the ones my sister ordered from here were full of chicken and topped with a nice chipotle/ranch like sauce which is similar.",0,0,1,10.5,"Positive","5"

Seriously though, I was the token black chic  and had a good time. Except for the one lady that seem to attach herself to me. Weird to say the least. Overall a cool place.

Be warned, do not attempt to take any pictures in this place. They will hunt you down and stop you. Especially if the ladies are ""performing"" on the bar. A big no-no!!!",1,1,4,0.5,"Positive","1"

The patio is in the afternoon shade and far enough off Scottsdale Road to avoid street noise. The seven Tapas (appetizers) attracted my interest and I ended up selecting 1) ebi prawn with grilled fennel, 2) tartine of bouillabaisse and 3) Medjul dates with merguez sausage, sugar cured bacon for the Happy Hour price of 3 for $10 vs the normal 3 for $15.  The single prawn was large and equal in quality to the fresh prawns I had just tasted in New Zealand plus the fennel added more flavor.  The tartine of bouillabaisse was mostly small shrimp but again very tasty and tempting to order a bowl the next time around.  The three Medjul dates with sausage/bacon  was an unusual combination to my culinary experience and superb in flavor.  The select wines were about half the normal price and a definite value at $5 per glass.  In talking with the waiter I noticed there is live jazz on Fridays between 5 and 8.  I will definitely have to return on a Friday to try the other tappas and listen to the Swedish singer who sings some songs in German... see tappas photo...

Nowhere to park, forced to valet, meh...

Love the atmosphere here: classy decor, beautiful patio. Everything on the menu looked delicious. I had a hard time choosing between many foods that I love: crab cakes, goat cheese, crepes... I wanted something lighter so I ordered the oriental chicken salad. In the meantime, our drinks were brought to the table. BFF pulled the spoon out of her iced tea to find that there was some leftover peanut butter still on it. The question is: who left it there? Don't know. Gross. This was pointed out to a server (not ours because she had not returned to our table). Our server brought out a new iced tea. She was polite, but not necessarily apologetic. 

When our meal was delivered to the table, BFF pointed out that there were tomatoes on her sandwich (she asked for no tomatoes). The server said that the other server probably grabbed the wrong plate. She came back from the kitchen twice to tell us that the new sandwich would be right out. So, I sat with my salad and waited to eat until BFF got her meal (It took a good 5-10 minutes for her new sandwich to come out). 

BFF raved about the dressing on her side salad. My salad was fine, but nothing to rave about (especially not for $13). The ingredients were fresh but the ""shredded chicken"" that was described on the menu appeared to be sliced chicken breast. To be honest, I prefer shredded chicken which is why I had decided on that particular salad. DISAPPOINTING.

The server arrived at the table to ask if we wanted to order dessert. We replied, ""no, thank you"". And she said something like, ""oh, come on, are you sure?"". Again, we declined but I really think she should have offered us free dessert after our bummer lunch.

The topper? 1 valet guy and 6 people in line to pick up their cars=a 10 minute wait just to leave the place.

enter, Hana.

first off, pre-game excitement for this BYOB, local, fresh sushi spot. Newcastle in hand, my friend and I strutted in here at around 8pm on a mildly warm Friday night. the place is jammed, and a couple parties stand around waiting for tables. great, a long wait. nope, two seats open at the bar. sat down, and our beer was immediately taken and put in a fridge to ensure it wouldn't lose any of it's remarkably smooth quality.  first beer is poured, and the excitement ensues. friendly and welcoming server devluges us in the specials, and unfortunately they were out of most of their fish as they have been for three weeks. toro and salmon were our options, so we went with a special for the night, the spider roll, and the vegas roll. also, edamame to start.

the food was superb. the edamame came spicy with a side of chili flakes and siracha for our never ending quest to burn the shit out of our mouths. a second round of newcastle was brought upon when our first was finished, and the sushi came shortly thereafter, looking like little pieces of art. both sets of rolls were enormous and came about 6 to a plate. the vegas roll was packed with cream cheese, avocado, and salmon. the special roll, the spider roll, was full of crispy soft shell crab and just enough spicy-ness for a much needed kick in the mouth. one dip in my wasabi/soy sauce concoction was more than enough.

our third and final beer was poured by an overly-anxious and over-stimulated, presumably newbie, bus boy. I had about 4 inches of head on my beer and my friend got hers spilled and nearly twice as much head.  he excellent waitress we had made up for this guys slips during the meal. the staff wished us a nice farewell on our way out, and I felt as though I had just left a very close friend's house. 

I will definitely be back with more six packs and good friends to share this little diamond in the rough with.",1,1,1,4.5,"Positive","4"

She's friendly, knowledgable, and makes herself available via e-mail or phone should you have any questions. Her knowledge on dogs is extensive, and even though you're just paying for the class, she'll gladly offer up advice on any issues you may be having with your dog. The classes seemed simple enough to me, but there was a client in my class that just wasn't picking it up at all and blatantly disregarding her techniques. I was impressed with how Leah handled the situation and the customer. She's very thorough, and always explains why she does things the way she does, and why it works. So there are no questions, and it's always made perfect sense to me. With the quality of service, and the knowledge that you get to tap into while you're training with Leah, you just can't find a better deal out there.

"9978","qaNZyCUJA6Yp0mvPBCknPQ","5","Why did I wait so long to try this neighborhood hot spot!  Having a father who grew up on Los Olivos I remained a loyal customer, that is, until last evening's change in plans lured me to the colorfully lit and lively patio of Los Sombreros Authentic Mexican Cafe & Cantina.  I am not an expert on ""authentic"" Mexican cuisine nor will I pretend to know what  the flavors of San Miguel de Allende taste like; however, I am a foodie so I know good food when I eat it.  

We chose to sit outdoor and enjoy the beautiful weather while taking in another Cardinal's loss!  (Sad, I know, since they were off to a great start)....  Lucky for us it was a calm Monday night and we had the full attention of our waiter, aka the bartender.  Phil (no need to blush if you read this) did a wonderful job walking us through their many margarita selections while also conveying his personal favorites that showcased his love for whiskey!  My friend allowed Phil to make his margarita as he felt a fine margarita should be made while I allowed Phil to concoct my special margarita while following strict no sugar, no salt, heavy on the tequila preferences...and that was just to start!  Perfectly crafted margaritas in hand, check.  Now what to eat for dinner.  

My friend ordered his beloved Mole poblano ($18.95) while I couldn't decide between the Smoked chicken enchiladas with salsa verde and chipotle crema (yumm) and the Pollo a la parilla with spinach in a chipotle cream sauce -or- tinga Poblana sauce($18.95).  I opted for the Pollo a la parilla with chipotle cream preparation and, once again, my dinner friend had 'order envy'!!  That's not to say his Mole was par (or dare I say sub-par) because it wasn't - it actually has received many culinary awards being named ""Best Mole"" both locally and nationally, but because the chipotle cream sauce combined with spinach, perfectly sautéed  chicken breasts and a side of warm corn tortilla is....AMAZZZZZZING!!!!  It's also fair that I note aside from the pricier entree dishes served w two sides (as we ordered), they also offer up tacos (3 at $10.95), various quesadillas (@ $5.95) and other lesser priced authentic eats including fresh guacamole, salads and more!  

Deciding I'd save room to see if they could satisfy my sweet tooth I boxed my remaining dinner as we read through each and every dessert.  Undecided, again, and so we trusted our gastronomy guide, Phil, to choose.  He selected the Mexican Chocolate Cream Pie to finish off the evening, and we happily finished off this delectable treat leaving one bite as I always like to do!!!   

Thank you, Phil and Los Sombreros, for the memorable dining experience.  The food was outstanding, margaritas made by Phil are the best, and the patio alone is enough to draw me back for HH or even a late night dessert.

"9985","spusZYROtBKw_5tv3gYm4Q","1","Went last night to Whore Foods to get basics to make pizza with, most clutch to the process was a three pack of yeast. Low and behold, the dirty hippie kids they have working there again didn't put something in the bag.

And this time it was the yeast.

I love the food there, but the employees are nothing more than entitled hippie kids from Scottsdale who can't be bothered to do their goddamn jobs! I am so sick of this crap with this corporation. Maybe its a Phoenix thing, or maybe its the hiring and firing processes of Whore Foods, but I am done shopping at any Whore Foods. In a place like Phoenix, where you have alternatives such as Sprouts, you'd think Whore Foods would smarten up.

Or when you try to ask someone who works here where something is, and they just walk by with their nose high in the air. I understand its important to show your fellow dirt merchants that you're a super star, but I don't work with you, I contribute to your salary and over inflated set of benefits for a grocery clerk, so do your goddamn job. Useless little girl in need of a shower and orthodontist. 

But alas, Whore Foods and its dirty hippie employees have alienated yet another person with a job and a degree into hating everything that place stands for.

Oh yea, one other thing, take the concealed firearm prohibition off of your stores. It didn't stop Jared Loughner from doing something horrid, and all it does is alienate law abiding citizens from their Constitutional rights.
